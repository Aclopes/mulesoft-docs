= Parallel Deployment From Studio
:keywords: deploy studio parallel deployment

Anypoint Studio allows you to deploy more than one application into the same Mule instance through link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/application-deployment#deploying-applications-in-parallel[parallel deployment].

[NOTE]
Deploying applications in parallel is supported since Mule 3.8.2

== Deploying more than one application simultaneously.

To deploy more than one application into the same Mule Runtime instance:

. Make sure all the Mule projects you want to deploy are open and visible in your Package Explorer.
+
[NOTE]
--
For this example, we are deploying `MuleApp1` and `MuleApp2` simultaneously.
--
+
. Go to *Run* and select *Run Configurations...*.
.. From the left navigation bar, select one of the Mule applications you want to deploy.
.. Under the _Mule domains/projects to launch_ select all the applications you want to deploy.

+
[CAUTION]
--
If the Mule application is not an open project in Studio, you won't be able to select it.
--
+
.. Select *Apply*.
.. Click *OK* to finish.
. After Studio finishes deploying your project, you should see a notification in the console showing all select applications deployed

== Limitations to parallel deployment

Deploying more than one Mule application simultaneously presents the following limitations:

* The maximum number of deployment threads is set to 20 and is not configurable.
* It is not possible to determine a particular start order cannot. To prevent deployment failure, ensure that the applications you are deploying are not dependent on each other.

Finally, consider that the more applications in parallel you deploy, the longer it will take Studio to start up the Mule Runtime instance.
