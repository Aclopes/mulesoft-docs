Learn how to create a connector to a web service using the Anypoint Connector DevKit.

This tutorial shows you how to code a connector to support authentication, connections, service operations and provides a foundation for more complex tasks. This is functionality that you as the developer expose to the Mule application developer that would use the connector.

== Steps to Build the Cookbook Connector

To build a basic connector for the {tutorial} service, we go through this tutorial to perform the following steps:

. Install the Cookbook client code on your local machine
. Create a Connector Project.
. Add the dependency that contains the client we will use to connect to the service.
. Add a configurable URL so that users can specify the URL where the service is hosted.
. Add an operation that users can consume in Anypoint Studio.
. Include code to manage connections.

== Prerequisites

* link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/setting-up-your-dev-environment[Setting Up Your Development Environment]

Before developing a connector you should have a working knowledge of link:/getting-started/index[Mule], link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[Anypoint Studio], and Java development in general, specifically the use of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/basics.html[Java annotations].

[[get-cookbook]]
== Install the Cookbook

Install the cookbook from GitHub:

. Clone the link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook[https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook] repository to your computer by running:
+
[source,bash,linenums]
----
cd ~/dev
git clone https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook.git
----
+
. Enter the directory `mule-cookbook` and run the following Maven command:
+
[source,bash,linenums]
----
mvn install eclipse:eclipse
----
+
. Open Anypoint Studio, import the `mule-cookbook` directory as an existing project. *File* > *Import* > *Existing Projects into Workspace*.
+
image::devkit-tutorial-30756.png[import existing - mule-cookbook]

This should create the several folders you see on the above screen in your workspace in Studio, which is visible in the *Package Explorer*.

== Create the {tutorial} Connector Project

With the `mule-cookbook` directory imported as an existing project into your workspace as instructed link:#get-cookbook[above], you can begin to create the connector project and start coding.

. In Anypoint Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Anypoint Connector Project* or right-click your project name in Package Explorer and click *New* > *Anypoint Connector Project*:
+
image::new-connector-1.png[width="500"]
+
. Select the project type you want to create. In this case, select *SDK Based*:
+
image::new0.png[width="500"]
+
. Specify the name of your connector and don't forget to uncheck the default generation before clicking *Finish*:
+
image:new1.png[width="550"]
+
This generates a project containing the structure and all required elements including a skeleton connector, icons, sample docs file, but no basic tests for your connector.
+

[TIP]
You can enable the DevKit view by clicking from the top bar *Window* > *Show View* > *Other*, and look for DevKit in the *MuleSoft* dropdown.


.DevKit View shows a compact view of the connector.

== Specify Connector Dependencies in pom.xml

. Add our client dependency so that we can use the Cookbook service in our connector. This way we can use the Java API to connect to the {tutorial}.
+
In your pom.xml file add:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>sdk-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----


== Define a Configurable Field for URL

In the `ConnectorConfig.java` file add the `@Configurable` annotation for the address where the {tutorial} service is hosted:

. Type *conf* at the editor of your connector config and use `control` + `space` to display the templates.
+
image::config-field.png[width="600"]
+
. Define a configurable field inside the `@Configuration`-annotated class with a default value for the endpoint our client connects to, for example, `+@Default("http://devkit-cookbook.cloudhub.io/soap")+`
. Any field marked with the `@Configurable` annotation must have a getter and a setter for that field.
+
See full link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/asciidoc/resources/java/v1/ConnectorConfig.java[Config] source code.

== Add Code to Initialize the Cookbook Client

In your `@Connector`-annotated class in the `Connector.java` file use the `@Start` annotation on a method to initialize the client.

[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v1/CookbookConnector.java[lines=30..35]
----

[NOTE]
====
Anypoint Connectors are made to be fully aware of Mule runtime's lifecycle without implementing any Mule-specific interface.

There is an annotation method for each of the four phases of the lifecycle.

When a method is annotated with one of these annotations, DevKit invokes it during the lifecycle phase that the annotation represents.
====

[[processor]]
== Add an Operation to the Connector

`getRecentlyAdded` is an operation we can implement quickly to start learning how to build our connector. The `getRecentlyAdded` call doesn't require authentication.

The client you are using provides a login call that initializes the token and uses it in subsequent requests.

. Remove the dummy `@Processor` operation from the `Connector.java` file.
+
. To add a processor simply type `proc` in the Studio code editor and use `ctrl` + `space` to display the templates and pick the simple processor.
+
image::processor1.png[width="600"]
+
. Change it to reflect the `getRecentlyAdded` method signature (see example implementation link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/asciidoc/resources/java/v1/CookbookConnector.java#L46[here]), and at this point you have the code in place to build your first connector, which should then be ready for testing.
. Run the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/creating-a-java-sdk-based-connector#generating-sources[Generate Sources] Action.
+
See full link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/asciidoc/resources/java/v1/CookbookConnector.java[Connector] source code.

[NOTE]
Resolve any package import errors by right-clicking your connector project in the Package Explorer of Studio. *Build Path* > *Add External Archives*. Add the applicable .jar files, for example, so your project can reference the cookbook `sdk-client`. This should stop any import errors on:
`import com.cookbook.tutorial.client.MuleCookBookClient;`
`import com.cookbook.tutorial.service.Recipe;`

You can check references in the properties for your project.

image::devkit-tutorial-af283.png[properties for cookbook connector project]

At this point you can <<install-guide,install>> this Connector and try it in Studio if you want.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As you modify your connector, you may start seeing error markers on the generated folder.

Just ignore them.

Once you regenerate the sources, the errors will go away as the generated code will be refreshed.
====


== Handle Connections

The session can expire and cause the connector to make a login request again.

DevKit provides a set of annotations to keep your code clean and handle the connection.

. In the `Config.java` file, change `@Configuration` to `@ConnectionManagement`
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=29]
----
+
. Make sure you have equipped the `MuleCookbookClient` in the `ConnectorConfig.java` with a getter and a setter.
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=91..100]
----
+
. Implement these four methods as shown:
+
* *`@Connect`* - Initialize the client, and if the login does not succeed, throw an exception.
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=41..50]
----
+
* *`@Disconnect`* - Release a connection.
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=55..58]
----
+
* *`@ValidateConnection`* - Check if your connection is alive.
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=63..66]
----
+
* *`@ConnectionIdentifier`* - Return a string value. This will only be used when debugging.
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[lines=71..74]
----
+
. Remove the declaration of `MuleCookBookClient` from  `CookbookConnector.java` and remove the method where a new `MuleCookBookClient` client is instantiated.
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
	private MuleCookBookClient client;

	@Start
	public void initialize() {
		client = new MuleCookBookClient(config.getAddress());
	}
----
+
. In our `getRecentlyAdded` method (annotated as a `@Processor`) call the `getclient` method, which should be defined in `ConnectorConfig.java`.
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{resourcesDir}/java/v2/CookbookConnector.java[lines=35..38]

See:

* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/asciidoc/resources/java/v2/CookbookConnector.java[Connector] source code.

* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-cookbook-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/asciidoc/resources/java/v2/ConnectorConfig.java[Config] source code.

If you install this version and try to run the Mule app we created earlier, you will see that it fails with a "SAXParseException" because we need to add a username and password to our configuration.

Just open the global configuration of your connector and check that there are two new fields, username and password. Configure them and you can run the app again.

== Customize Exception and Error Handling

This section explains how to improve exception handling and errors.

The `@Handler` annotation is useful for avoiding duplicate code for handling exceptions, and makes your code easier to read.

When handling messages retrieved from the API, if you see the message is uninformative and you know how to improve it, use the `@Handler` mechanism to enrich the error information provided to the user.

To see how it works, let's create a handler in the connector code for the `InvalidEntityException` thrown by the Cookbook SDK `create()` call:

.This `create()` call from `MuleCookBookClient.java` throws `InvalidEntityException`
[source,java,linenums]
----
@Override
   public CookBookEntity create(CookBookEntity entity) throws InvalidEntityException,
           SessionExpiredException {
       Create request = factory.createCreate();
       request.setEntity(entity);
       try {
           return port.create(request, token).getReturn();
       } catch (InvalidTokenException e) {
           logger.warn("Should never happen.", e);
           throw new RuntimeException(e);
       }
     }
----

. Create a new *Anypoint Connector Component* by right-clicking and navigating to that item in the menu, or via *New* > *Other*, selecting this option in the wizard.
+
image::new-component.png[width="600"]
+
. Select the package, component type and class name and click on Finish.
+
image::new-component-2.png[width="600"]
+
. Improve the error message when `InvalidEntityException` is thrown.

== Debugging Your Connector

After successfully installing your connector, you can start using your connector in a Mule application.
You can add breakpoints in the source code of the connector to debug it.
If your connector is a Community connector, the source code ships automatically in the installed connector.
If your connector is an Enterprise connector, you need to manually attach the source code of your JAR.

WARNING: To correctly debug your code, take into account that the Mule app you are running is using the latest installed version, so if you make changes, and you want to debug the Mule app, you need to re-install the connector.

Debugging your connector when running your test is as simple as debugging any Java class.

You just need to set a breakpoint in your connector code.
