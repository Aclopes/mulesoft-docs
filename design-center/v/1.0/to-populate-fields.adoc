= To Populate Fields

In Design Center, the UI offers several shortcuts that help you populate fields in an easier way.

== Function Mode

Most fields can be populated with either a static value, or an expression. Switch between one modality or another by clicking the *expression button*:

If the expression mode is enabled on a field, you can write a link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave[DataWeave] expression. This can consist of a simple reference to a part of the element's input (such as 'payload'), or may also involve link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-operations[operations] to manipulate incoming values into something else. Smart autocomplete options help you write valid expressions that reference existing elements.


[TIP]
When using the expression editor, anything you type into the field is considered a DataWeave expression. Hence, you shouldn't wrap your expression in `#[]`, as this is already implied.

== Map Button

Some fields also include a *Map button*:

When you click this button, it opens an editor window, where you can graphically drag and drop elements from the incoming message and use the full set of features of the  link:/design-center/v/1.0/transform-message-component-concept-design-center[About the Transform Message Component] to build an expression.

== Dictionary Editor

Certain fields in certain cards accept an input of type *dictionary*, these include a dictionary editor. This editor lets you set up the keys and values of an object as a simple table, which makes it more readable and less error-prone. Simply click the *Add* button, this opens a popup window where you can define a key and value to add.
