= To Change the Target Output of a Transformation (Design Center)
:keywords:

By default, the Transform Message component outputs to the message payload. You can change this target, so that the result of your transformation populates another part of the output such as a property or variable.

[NOTE]
In case you're using DW through the Map button, the target is already implicitly the field on which you are editing.

== Change the Target to the Message Attributes

. Click on the title of the output section, which should say Output Payload by default.
. In the dropdown menu select Attributes.

This opens a new transformation that outputs to the new target. The graphical and in the source code view as well as the preview all correspond to this new transformation.

== Change the Target to a Variable

. Click on the title of the output section, which should say Output Payload by default.
. In the dropdown menu Select *Add transformation*
