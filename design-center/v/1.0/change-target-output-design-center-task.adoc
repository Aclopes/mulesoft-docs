= To Change the Target Output of a Transformation (Design Center)
:keywords:

By default, the Transform Message component outputs to the message payload. You can change this target, so that the result of your transformation populates another part of the output such as a property or variable.

. Go to the *Mappings* tab
. Click on the title of the output section
. In the dropdown menu Select *Add transformation*

. Specify where in the output Mule message to place the result of yourÂ DataWeave transform. In case you're creating a new variable or property, you must also set a name for it.

[NOTE]
====
In case you're using DW through the Map button, the target is already implicitly the field on which you are editing.

Note that by changing the target, the editor displays a different DataWeave script, and preview section, corresponding to the selected target.
