= To Change the Target Output of a Transformation (Design Center)
:keywords:

By default, the Transform Message component outputs to the message payload. You can change this target, so that the result of your transformation populates another part of the output such as a property or variable.

. Click the *Edit Current Target* button image:using-dataweave-in-studio-47984.png[] above the DataWeave code editor.


. Specify where in the output Mule message to place the result of yourÂ DataWeave transform. In case you're creating a new variable or property, you must also set a name for it.
