. Name your project

. Select *Mule Application* as the type of your project from the dropdown menu in *Project Type*


. Select the target link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/environments[environment] for designing and debugging the application.

[NOTE]
====
For this initial stage, you can only pick design environments. Once your application is ready, you can promote it to any production or sandbox environment that you have access to.

Through the use of design environments, you can keep your works-in-progress safely away from the public eye until they're ready to be promoted to production.
