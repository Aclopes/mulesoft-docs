== About Connector Configurations

By design, in Design Center you define reusable connector configurations as separate from the individual implementations of these.

In this way, when creating a project that utilizes several instances of a same card, these settings can be shared and only need to be provided once.

For example: you could have multiple HTTP connectors in your project, all of them relying on the same host and port and implementing the same SSL certificates, but each triggering a different flow via a different subpath. The host, port and SSL information is defined in an HTTP Configuration, and each of your HTTP connectors can reference it.

== Create a Connector Configuration


. Add a connector to your flow, it will notify you that a configuration is required through an error message on the top margin.

. Click the *Set up* link to create a new connector configuration for that card.

. Give your configuration a *Configuration Name*. This will come in handy if you want to apply this same configuration to another similar element in your project.

. Provide any other necessary fields and click *Save*

[NOTE]
If you create any more cards of the same type in your project, these will automatically reference the existing configuration unless you specify otherwise.
