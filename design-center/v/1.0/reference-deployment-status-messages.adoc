= Reference: Deployment Status Messages
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

When creating Mule applications in Design Center, there's a status indicator in the top navbar that shows the state of your application's deployment and alerts you about possible errors with the deployment.

See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-deploy-a-project[To Deploy a Project] for a better understanding of how Design Center deploys to both design and production environments.

The table below lists all the possible states for this indicator and their meanings.
