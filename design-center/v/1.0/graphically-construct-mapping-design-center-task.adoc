= To Graphically Construct a Mapping (Design Center)
:keywords:

Through the graphical UI of the Transform component you can do the tasks below. When doing each, the necessary lines are added to the DataWeave source code to describe the action.

== Map a Field

Drag an element on the input structure over to another on the output structure, this casts a line that joins them.

== Map a Structure

Drag a high-level structure that contains lists of elements or inner fields onto a compatible one in the output. This creates a shaded region covering all the mapped structure. Fields that have identical names in these structures are automatically mapped too.

== Remove a Mapping

. Select the corresponding input element.
+
A trash can icon image:graphically-construct-mapping-design-center-task-2457b.png[] appears on the connection.
+
. Click the trash can icon.


== Set a Fixed Value or Function


. Double click on a field (that doesn't have any children) in the output tree. This adds a function icon image:graphically-construct-mapping-design-center-task-8a822.png[] next to it.

. A box with the default value `null` appears. You can change `null` to anything you want, like:
+

* A fixed text value by using " ".
* A reference to an input field.
* A statement that includes DataWeave functions.

This experience relates to that of using a spreadsheet, where each field can be a direct reference to another, or can be the product of a function that involves such references.

[NOTE]
Functions can be removed by clicking on the trash-can icons that appear next to them.
