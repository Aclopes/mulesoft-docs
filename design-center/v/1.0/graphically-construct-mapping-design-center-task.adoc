= To Graphically Construct a Mapping (Design Center)
:keywords:

Through the graphical UI of the Transform component you can do the tasks below. When doing each, the necessary lines are added to the DataWeave source code to describe the action.

== Map a Field

Drag an element on the input structure over to another on the output structure, this casts a line that joins them.

== Map a Structure

Drag a high-level structure that contains lists of elements or inner fields onto another in the output. This creates a shaded region covering all the mapped structure. Fields that have identical names in these structures are automatically mapped too.

== Remove a Mapping

Hover on an existing line or shaded region and click on the trash-can icon.

== Set a Fixed Value or Function


. Double click on a field in the output tree. This adds a function icon image:using-dataweave-in-studio-66cdc.png[] next to it.

. A new line is added to the DataWeave code that assigns a default `null` value to the field. This line is highlighted. Change its value to anything you want. This experience relates to that of using a spreadsheet, where each field might be a direct reference to another, or might be the product of a function that involves such references.

You can add:

* A fixed string value by using " ".
* A reference to an input field.
* A DataWeave statement that includes functions.

[NOTE]
Functions can be removed by clicking on the trash-can icons that appear on the connections that point to them.
