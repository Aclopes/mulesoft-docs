= To Run an Application in a Design Environment (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

The Design Center allows you to push your applications to run without needing to leave the editing screen. You can use this as a way to test and debug your application as you develop it, periodically updating it on the design environment it runs in to check that it works as expected.


== Run on a Design Environment

. As soon as you create a Mule application project, a workspace in a design environment is reserved for your application.

+
[NOTE]
To run your application, your Anypoint Platform account must have at least one CloudHub worker with 0.2 Vcores available in the selected environment.

. On the top navbar, the status of your project changes from *Undeployed* to *Deploying* to *Running* to indicate that the workspace is ready for your application. It otherwise indicates if there are any errors.

. Build out the flows of your application and set up every required field. The project must be free of errors before you can run it.

. Click the *Sync* button. Design Center then updates the current state of your application to run in this workspace. When done, the status changes back to *Started*.

+
[NOTE]
As you keep making changes to your project, note that these don't affect your running application till you click the *Sync* button.

. Once it's running, you can also configure finer details about the application through the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] pannel. To do so, click the dropdown next to the status and select *view in runtime manager*.



Once your application is running:

* Flows that begin with HTTP connectors can be triggered by sending requests to the corresponding address.

* Flows that begin with Poll cards trigger the flow at the selected interval.

+
[NOTE]
Note that this keeps occurring until you pause or alter the application. Altering the project alone doesn't take effect till you sync changes to the running application.

See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-debug-a-mule-project[To Debug a Mule Project] for more details on how to do this.


== Update an Application

Click the *Sync* button on the top navbar. This pushes the current state of your project to overwrite what was previously running.


== Restart an Application

To pause the application, select *Pause* in the dropdown next to the deployment status. Note that this keeps the workerspace active and the CloudHub resources in use.

== Restart a Workspace

Click the dropdown button next to the status and select *restart workspace*. This deletes the current workspace and creates an empty new workspace with a new IP.

To upload your project to this new workspace, you must click *Sync* once again.

[TIP]
This is the same as restarting the CloudHub worker where your application is running.
