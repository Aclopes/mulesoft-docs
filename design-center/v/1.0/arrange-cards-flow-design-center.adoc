= Arrange Cards to Build a Flow (Design Center)
:keywords:


Mule projects contain flows. These are composed of elements that are chained together, where each sends its output to the next. Each of these elements is represented by a card.

Each flow must have a trigger that sets it into action, either by receiving an outside event (like an HTTP request) or by waiting for a specific date or time. The exception to this rule is that you may have a flow with no trigger, but that is referenced by another flow that does.

== Add a First Component

When creating a new flow, a menu shows all of the elements that are possible to add in that position of the flow.




== Add a component


. Hover over the arrows that join components image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-d6a6a.png[] to reveal a plus sign, or click on the plus sign that appears at the end of the flow image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[].

. You can then pick which component to add.


Some tips about this menu:

* You can use the search box to find a component by name.
* A dropdown menu lets you filter to a category of components.
* When hovering over a connector in the list, an information icon image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-014d5.png[] is displayed. Click this to go to the Exchange page for that connector, where you can learn more about it.



== Add Scopes

Some of the things you can add to a flow are Scopes. These don't perform any actions on their own, but they're rather buckets into which you can place other components. Any components that are placed within a scope change their behavior



== Reorder Components

If you want to change the order of components you've already placed and configured, simply drag them and drop them onto another position in the flow.
