= To Preview the Output of a Transformation(Design Center)
:keywords:

You can provide sample input data to your Transform component to see how the transformation affects it. You don't need to run your application to use this feature. A sample output is updated in real time as you make changes both to the sample input and the transformation.


. On the input pane, select one of the parts of the input (the Payload, Attributes or a specific Variable).

. At the bottom of the window, select the Edit Sample Data icon image:preview-transformation-output-design-center-1a65a.png[].

+
. The Sample Data tab opens and is populated.

* If you defined your Data Type through a sample, these same values are used.
* If you defined your Data Type through a schema or it was automatically defined, values are populated with the string `????` as a placeholder.
+
[NOTE]
====
When the input is of type POJO (Plain Old Java Object), samples must be written in DataWeave format. This is not a transformation in itself, just a way to express how data is structured.
====

. Replace these placeholder values with different values.

+
As you make changes in the sample data or the transformation, notice how the output preview changes.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your transformer has multiple outputs (for example, to both the payload and a variable), the *Preview* pane displays the one corresponding to the currently selected transformation.

When the output is of type POJO (Plain Old Java Object), the preview is represented in DataWeave format.
====

. Test your transformation for any special characters or structures that might arrive, verify that the output is what you expected.

+
[NOTE]
Note that samples defined in this pane work only within the *Transform* component, they don't affect other components in the flow. They aren't used in your running application as default values nor in any other way.
