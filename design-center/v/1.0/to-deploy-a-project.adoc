= To Deploy a Project
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

The Design Center allows you to deploy applications straight from the editor, without needing to leave the editing screen. You can use this as a way to test and debug your application as you develop it, periodically deploying it to a design environment to check that it works as expected. When your application is finished, you can also use this feature to deploy your application to a production environment.



== Deploy to a Design Environment

. As soon as you create a Mule application project, a workspace in a design environment is reserved for your application.

+
[NOTE]
To deploy your application, your Anypoint Platform account must have at least one CloudHub worker with 0.2 Vcores available in the selected environment.

. On the top navbar, the status of your project changes from *Undeployed* to *Deploying* to *Running* to indicate that the workspace is ready for your application. It otherwise indicates if there are any errors.
+

. Build out the flows of your application and set up every required field. The project must be free of errors before you can deploy it.

. Click the *Sync* button. Design Center then deploys the current state of your application to this workspace. When done, the status changes back to *Started*.

+
[NOTE]
As you keep making changes to your project, note that these don't affect your deployed application till you click the *Sync* button.

. Once deployed, you can also configure finer details about the deployment through the link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager] pannel. To do so, click the dropdown next to the status and select *view in runtime manager*.



Once deployed, your application is active.

* Flows that begin with HTTP connectors can be triggered by sending requests to the corresponding address.

* Flows that begin with Poll cards trigger the flow at the selected interval.

+
[NOTE]
Note that this keeps occurring until you pause or alter the application. Altering the project alone doesn't take effect till you sync changes to the deployed application.

See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-debug-a-mule-project[To Debug a Mule Project] for more details on how to do this.


== Update an Application

Click the *Sync* button on the top navbar. This pushes the current state of your project to overwrite what was previously deployed.


== Restart an Application

To pause the application, select *Pause* in the dropdown next to the deployment status. Note that this keeps the workerspace active and the CloudHub resources in use.

== Restart a Workspace

Click the dropdown button next to the status and select *restart workspace*. This deletes the current workspace and creates an empty new workspace with a new IP.

To upload your project to this new workspace, you must click *Sync* once again.

[TIP]
This is the same as restarting the CloudHub worker where your application is running.





////
== The Deployment Panel

You can edit and view more details about your deployment through the *Deployment Panel*, to open it click the corresponding icon:

On this panel you can view the deployment console, which displays details about the current state of the deployment as well as specific error messages.

You can also change the name of the app on CloudHub, which also changes the address with which your service is exposed.
////

== Promote an Application

Once you consider your application is ready to publish, you can promote it to a different environment.


. Click the *Promote Application* button on the top navbar image:deploying-your-project-a675b.png[]

. Select a name under which to deploy your application and the CloudHub link:/access-management/environments[environment] in which to deploy.

. Set up the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-connector-configurations[Connector Configurations] of your project for this new environment.
+

+
The fields exposed in this screen are the same as those that can be set in the link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-set-up-connector-configurations[Connector Configurations] of each element in your flow.
+
This allows you to tweak your application with values and credentials that may point to similar assets that exist in the new environment. You may have – for example – a staging database for your staging deployments, and a production database for your production deployments. This eliminates the need to add property placeholders.

. After deploying, you can go to the Runtime Manager console and link:/runtime-manager/managing-deployed-applciations[manage your application] in the same way as any other.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that applications are deployed to a specific link:/access-management/environments[environment] (i.e: Dev, QA, Production).

Make sure you're aware of the consequences of deploying to the selected environment, as by deploying it you might be giving your app more exposure than you want to give it at the time.

== Deploy To Other Servers

For deploying to customer-managed Mule runtimes (all except CloudHub), you must first export your project to Anypoint Studio, and then export a .zip deployable archive from there.  (link)
??? still true??   now we have a full fledged app
