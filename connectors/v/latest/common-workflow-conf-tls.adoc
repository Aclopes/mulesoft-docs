= Workflow: Configuring TLS

// Not working on qax June 10, 2017

FIPS stands for “Federal Information Processing Standards.” 

The Mule 'conf' folder located in your $MULE_HOME directory includes two files that allow you to fine-tune the configuration of SSL connectors by manually setting which cipher suites and protocols Mule will use:

tls-default.conf (Allows fine-tuning when Mule is not configured to run in FIPS security mode)

tls-fips140-2.conf (Allows fine-tuning when Mule is running in FIPS security mode)
