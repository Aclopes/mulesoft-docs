// Anypoint Studio, Design Center: *Email* connector

[[short_description]]
Lists all email in a mailbox folder that matches specified criteria, such as the sender, text in the subject, a given date, or other properties. Supports pagination of the results. Defaults to the inbox folder.

Note that email attributes contain metadata, such as a subject, an ID, sent and received dates, various address types (such as CC and BCC), email flags (such as Answered, Deleted, Seen).
//_TODO, PROVIDE REALISTIC EXAMPLE THAT USES THIS FUNCTIONALITY_
