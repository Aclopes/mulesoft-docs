Anypoint Studio, Design Center: FTP connector

[[short_description]]
An SFTP configuration is required for all SFTP operations with the FTP (not SFTP) connector.

. Open the `FTP Configuration` window.
+ You can open it from any FTP operation in your flow or from the *Connections Explorer* in Anypoint Studio.
. Provide a *Name* for the configuration. Example: `FTP configuration`.
. Provide connection settings:
  ** Provide the connection *Type*: `SFTP Connection`
  ** *Host* domain name or IP address of the SFTP server. Example: `sftp.some.server.com`
  ** *Port* for the connection. Defaults to `22` for SFTP.
  ** *Password* (if required by the host)
  ** *Passphrase* for the *Identity File* (if provided).
  ** *Identity File* location for a PKI private key.
. Provide any optional settings that you need:
  ** *Working Directory*, the root of any relative paths you specify. Defaults to the remote server default. Example: `my/working/dir`
  ** *Preferred Authentication Methods* (one of these): _TODO, WHAT'S THE DEFAULT?_
    *** `gssapi_with_mic`
    *** `public_key`
    *** `keyboard_interactive`
    *** `password`
  ** *Known Hosts File* to check whether the server key matches. Aborts if not.
