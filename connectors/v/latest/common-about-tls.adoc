= About TLS

Design Center supports Transport Level Security (TLS) 1.1/1.2. You can configure one- or two-way authentication. A key store and a trust store configuration sets up two-way authentication. The server implements the key store to enforce two-way authentication with the client. 

You can configure two passwords for the key store: 

* One to access the entire key store file
* Another (keyPassword) to access the private key of the server inside the key store file

If the client requires a certificate from the server, add the <tls:trust-store> element. Set the path to the location of the trust store file that contains the certificates of the trusted servers.

If the server validates certificates from the clients, add the <tls:key-store> element. Set the path field to the location of the key store file that contains the private and public keys of the client.
