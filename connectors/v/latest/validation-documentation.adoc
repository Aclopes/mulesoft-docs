+++
Allows performing validations and throw an Exception if the validation fails

== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
An extension which provides validation capabilities by exposing a series of Validators as ExtensionModel
OperationModels
This class not only defines the extension but also acts as the only available ConfigurationModel for it. It allows
parametrizing the Validators with i18n bundles (through a I18NConfig
