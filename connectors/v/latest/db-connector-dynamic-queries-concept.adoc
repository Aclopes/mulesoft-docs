= About Dynamic Queries

You might want to parameterize the WHERE clause and also parts of the query itself. For example, you might want to issue queries of online, historic tables depending on a condition. You might have complex queries in which the project columns need to vary. In these cases, use expressions in the query:
 
[source,xml,linenums]
----
   <set-variable variableName="table" value="PLANET"/>
   <db:select config-ref="dbConfig">
       <db:sql>#["SELECT * FROM $(table) WHERE name = :name‚Äù]</db:sql>
       <db:input-parameters>
           #[{'name' : payload}]
       </db:input-parameters>
   </db:select>
----
 
In this example, a full expression builds the query using a variable `table`. Although the query text is dynamic, it still uses input parameters.
