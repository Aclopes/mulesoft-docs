= About Connecting to an Oracle Database

You need to configure a connection to an Oracle database. In the configuration, you need to set up the Oracle JDBC driver. In Design Center, for example, assuming you have the driver on a file system, you click Set Up > Upload to set up the driver in Exchange.

To configure the database, you provide the following information:

* Host: The host portion of the URL in the connection string. In Design Center, the host needs to be a location on the Internet.
* Port: The default is 1521.
* User: The name of the user that is set up for authentication against the database.
* Password: The password that is set up for authentication against the database.
* Instance: The name of the Oracle DB instance you want to connect to the app.
