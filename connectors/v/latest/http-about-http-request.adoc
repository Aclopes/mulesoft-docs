= About Receiving HTTP Requests
:keywords: connectors, http, https

The HTTP connector's listener receives requests via HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The request body is passed to the next element of the flow as the `Message` payload while the method, headers, query parameters and so on are returned in the attributes as `HttpRequestAttributes` which you can access the attributes using DataWeave.

== About HTTP Requests and their Responses

A request received by listener generates a Mule Event and you can refer to parts of it. The following diagram explains how each request part is mapped to a Mule Event and how to access each.

You can read the request body mapped to the payload with DataWeave.

The response to a request can include the following information:

* Status code
* Reason phrase
* Body
* Headers

You can configure these both for the successful and failing execution of the listener's flow. The former defaults will feature the payload as body and a 200 status code, while the latter defaults will feature the error description as body and a 500 status code.

== Securing Requests and Responses

You can use Transport Layer Security (TLS) and configure HTTPS by providing a key store with your certificate. You can also enable 2 way authentication by providing a trust store as well.
