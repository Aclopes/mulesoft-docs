= To Query a Database

This procedure queries the database for product information, logs the names of product lines, and inspects sample output. This procedure builds on the example that connects a Mule app to a database using the Classic Models sample database.

. Assuming you have connected a database to the flow for a Select operation, set up the query:
* In Database - Select, in General, enter SQL query text, omitting the semicolon. For example:
+
`SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3`
+
* Close the connector.
. Click Run or Update.
. Select Running > Copy Link, and go to the URL. For example, paste the link in a browser or a client, such as Postman, and press return.
+
The HTTP listener hears the request, starts the app, and a file containing the binary query results is downloaded from the browser to your localhost. You can delete the downloaded file.
+
. Open the database connector and select Output.
+
The results of the query appear in JSON format:
+
----
[
  {
	"buyPrice": 48.81,
	"productScale": "1:10",
	"productLine": "Motocycles",
...
  }
]
----
. Log the product line names that are included in the query output: 
* For example, add a logger to the flow.
* In General, click image:function-key.png[f of x key] to create the message using an expression.
* Delete the quotation marks that enclose a literal string. Type *payload* followed by and period,  and pause for hints.
+
The database column names and other valid payloads appear.
+
image:logger-data-sense.png[buyPrice Array(Number), MSRP, productCode, productDescription, productLine, productName, productScale]
+
* Select a database column name. For example, select the following column.
+
payload.productLine
+
. Click Sync and select Running > Copy Link, paste the link in a browser, and go to the URL.
. Expand the log tab at the bottom of Design Center to view the log.
+
In the log, the product line names included in the query output appear:
+
`INFO  16:03:47  [Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Motorcycles]`
