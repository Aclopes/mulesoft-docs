. Create a key store. For example, use the Java keytool as follows:
+
`keytool -genkey -alias serverkey -keyalg RSA -keystore httplistener.jks`
+
* In response to keytool prompts, enter a password and arbitrary values to other prompts except the last one. For example, enter the following values:
+
----
Enter keystore password: mule123 
Re-enter new password: mule123
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  kahn
  What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  MuleSoft
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  MuleSoft Inc
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  San Francisco
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  CA
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  01
Is CN=kahn, OU=MuleSoft, O=MuleSoft Inc, L=San Francisco, ST=CA, C=01 correct?
  [no]:
* To the last keytool prompt, press RETURN to use the same password as the key store password.
+
----
Enter key password for <serverkey>
	(RETURN if same as keystore password):  (mule123)
