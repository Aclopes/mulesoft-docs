= About Connecting to a Generic Database

A generic database configuration connects your Mule app to any RDBMS. In the configuration, you need to set up the driver compatible with the database you want to connect to your app. In Design Center, for example, assuming you have the driver on a file system, you click Set Up > Upload to set up the driver in Exchange.

You need to provide the URL and fully qualified class name of the JDBC driver you want to use. For example, you are using the default database password and user name and you want to connect to a database named stock. Configure the URL as follows:

`+jdbc:postgresql://myhost:5432/stock?password=postgres&user=postgres+`

You also need to configure the driver class name. For Postgres, for example, this name is `org.postgresql.Driver`.
