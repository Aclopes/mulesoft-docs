= VMWare OVA Guide for Installing the Anypoint Platform On-premises Edition
:keywords:anypoint platform, on premises, vmware

== Hardware requirements

Each node, whether a virtual machine or must meet the basic hardware link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.5.0/prerequisites-platform-on-premises[prerequisites]. Generally, each node in the cluster can be expected to use 8 processor cores, 32GB of RAM, and just over 500GB of storage, spread across several volumes. It's important that disks are relatively high performance, and ideally separate physical devices.

== Importing the OVA

In VMWare Workstation, you can import a virtual appliance that is configured to meet the installation prerequisites. First, from the 'File' menu, select 'Open...'. Then select the provided `.ova` file.

You may be asked to confirm the import, and at this point can give the VM a unique name.

Go ahead and click 'Import' when you're ready to proceed.

You may receive a warning about OVF specification conformance or virtual hardware compliance. This is expected, and you can simply click 'Retry' to proceed.

The import process will take a moment, and afterwards, the VM should display in your Library.

You can now start the virtual machine, and login. The user `anypoint` user is configured with the password `mulesoft123`. You should change this password to something more secure once you login. The `anypoint` user is also configured to be able to use `sudo` to perform privileged operations.

Once you log in, you'll need to grab the installer. You can download it using `curl` or `wget`, or upload it using SSH or SCP. This step depends on how you have your network and infrastructure configured.
