:keywords: agent, mule, servers, monitor, notifications, external systems, third party, get status, metrics

In order to troubleshoot and give more insights of a malfunction Mule Agent Plugin installation we provide a new `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_debug` script.

If you experience any issue with the Mule Agent Plugin and/or with the Anypoint platform in which this Runtime is managed we will ask to provide the output of this script before fill any support ticket.

When you execute this script it will collect the following information that will help us troubleshoot your issue:
1. Discover mule/agent JVM process
2. Extract Thread dump (not forced if possible)
3. Extract Heap dump
4. Extract machine generic data: Java version, CPU usage, Memory usage, Disk usage.
5. Copy all logs
6. Copy Mule Agent Configuration files
7. ZIP all the information

After the script is executed you can find a `$MULE_HOME/bin/snapshot_201701021410.zip` file that you can send to our support engineers to help troubleshoot your issues.
