The topics under this document describe the underlying architecture and the advanced configuration settings for the Runtime Manager Agent.

For the vast majority of use cases, all you'll need to do with the Runtime Manager Agent is install it and configure it according to what you can read in link:/runtime-manager/installing-and-configuring-mule-agent[Installing and Configuring the Runtime Manager Agent]

If you wish to use the Runtime Manager Agent for more than managing the communication between the link:/runtime-manager/index[Runtime Manager] and Runtimes on-premises, then you may find the documents in this section helpful:

* link:/runtime-manager/runtime-manager-agent-architecture[Runtime Manager Agent Architecture]
* link:/runtime-manager/runtime-manager-agent-api[Agent API]
* link:/runtime-manager/event-tracking[Event Tracking]
* link:/runtime-manager/internal-handler-buffering[Internal Handler Buffering]
* link:/runtime-manager/extending-the-runtime-manager-agent[Extending the Runtime Manager Agent]

[NOTE]
None of these topics relate to the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.8/index[Mule Management Console]. These topics are about the Runtime Manager Agent that communicates the Runtime Manager with local runtimes.
