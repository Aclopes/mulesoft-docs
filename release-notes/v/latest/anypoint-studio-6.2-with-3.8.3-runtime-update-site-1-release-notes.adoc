== Migration Guide

Users running Studio 6.0 can update to this new version directly from the Studio link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-update-sites[Update Site].

[TIP]
--
Updating your Anypoint Studio version using the update site does not update the bundled version of the Mule runtime. +
To get the latest runtime version after updating Studio follow link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio#updating-studio[these steps].
--

If you are running an older version than Studio 6.0, then instead of updating your existing version of Studio, you would need to download and run the latest installer to install a fresh new full copy.

When opening a previous workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the existing types and show them in your project.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
