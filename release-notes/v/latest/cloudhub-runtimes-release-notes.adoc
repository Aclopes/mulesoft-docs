This release includes the following:

* Fixes a vulnerability with JAXB and Jersey which could result in a DoS attack
* Fixes a problem where a 403 error would appear in the logs when using Insight
* Fixes an issue with DataWeave which would result in running out of space on the drive for 3.8.x
* Fixes an issue with APIkit where it would cast a numeric string query param to Integer, which then caused a InvalidQueryParameterException

Runtimes updated include 3.5.4, 3.7.4, and 3.8.2
