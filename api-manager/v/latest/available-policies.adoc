Anypoint Platform includes the following out-of-the-box policies in addition to the Simple Security Manager, required for the Basic Auth (Basic 1 name-1 pass) policy:

link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Client ID Enforcement]:: All calls to the API must include a valid client ID and client secret.
link:/api-manager/accessing-your-api-behind-a-firewall[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]:: CORS  is a standard mechanism that allows JavaScript XMLHttpRequest (XHR) calls executed in a web page to interact with resources from non-origin domains. CORS is a commonly implemented solution to the "same-origin policy" that is enforced by all browsers. This policy enables all origins, and makes all resources of an API public. To configure a CORS policy, see link:/api-manager/cors-policy[Applying and Editing a CORS Policy].
HTTP Basic Authentication:: Enforces authentication per the details configured in a Security Manager policy.
link:/api-manager/ip-blacklist[IP Blacklist]:: API calls from a defined set of IP addresses are denied.
link:/api-manager/ip-whitelist[IP Whitelist]:: All API calls are limited to to a defined set of IP addresses.
JSON Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious JSON that could cause problems.
link:/api-manager/ldap-security-manager[LDAP Security Manager]:: Injects an LDAP-based security manager into the target API.
link:/api-manager/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement Using External Provider Policy]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. You must reference an external application that serves as the OAuth provider.
link:/api-manager/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Provider] (deprecated):: Configures an OAuth 2.0 authorization server at the target API. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway Runtime.
link:/api-manager/oauth-2.0-provider-and-oauth-2.0-token-enforcement-policies[OAuth 2.0 Access Token Enforcement] (deprecated):: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OAuth 2.0 token. This policy is deprecated as of version 2.0 of the API Gateway Runtime.
link:/access-management/external-identity[OpenAM Access Token Enforcement]:: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid OpenAM token. This policy is only available to organizations using an OpenAM Federated Identity Management system.
link:/api-manager/pingfederate-oauth-token-enforcement-policy[PingFederate Access Token Enforcement] :: Configures the API so that its endpoints require a mandatory and valid PingFederate token. This policy is only available to organizations using a PingFederate Federated Identity Management system.
link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[Rate Limiting – SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Rate Limiting]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is rate limited at a maximum value specified in the policy. The rate limiting is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are rejected.
Simple Security Manager:: A placeholder security manager that can be configured with a hard-coded username and password for testing purposes.
link:/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling-sla-based-policies[Throttling -SLA-Based]:: The number of messages per time period processed by an API is throttled at a maximum value specified in the SLA tier. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing. Enforcement is based on the client ID passed in the request.
link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies[Throttling]:: The number of messages processed by an API per time period is throttled at a maximum value specified in the policy. The throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Any messages beyond the maximum are queued for later processing.
XML Threat Protection:: Protects the target API against malicious XML that could cause problems.
