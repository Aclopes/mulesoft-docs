= Create an API Notebook
:keywords: api, raml, client, notebook

An API Notebook is a web-based tool for building interactive tutorials and examples in a JavaScript scripting workspace. You present the Notebook on your API Portal to users of your API who can explore the API. API Notebook can generate an API client based on a RAML API definition, and through it perform authenticated live calls on a real server or on just an empty API interface.  From the RAML definition, API Notebook obtains information about the API's resources, methods, required arguments, and so on. To create a Notebook for an API that is not RAML-based,Â link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy[create a proxy for the API].

In this tutorial, you create an API Notebook to connect to a RAML-based API managed by API Manager. 

== Prerequisites

To create the API Notebook in this tutorial you need:

* A public API portal for the API
* The link:/access-management/roles[level of permission or role] required for creating a Notebook

You can create an API Notebook using the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook page]. You can also create and add an API Notebook to an API portal as you design the portal. This tutorial creates a Notebook from the API Notebook page.

To create and add an API Notebook:

. Go to the API Version Administration Page, click *Edit portal*.
. On the *Add* drop-down, select *API Notebook*.
+
The API Notebook canvas appears.
+
. Although a default client already exists for documentation purposes, create another one. Hover over the circular widget above the code cell, and click *Insert API Client*.
+

+
The *Insert an API Client* dialog appears.
+
. Enter the API name `T-Shirt Ordering Service` in the search box. Scroll to the T-Shirt Ordering Service item in the list that bears the name of your organization, and click *Add*.
+
The API Client code appears in the code cell prefaced by a comment that looks something like this:
+
----
// Read about the T-Shirt Ordering Service at https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/mulesoft-7/#/portals/organizations/2dfeffce-f770-4317-ad32-a2a9c01050f2/apis/4358/versions/4394
API.createClient('tShirtOrderingService', 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/repository/v2/organizations/2dfeffce-f770-4317-ad32-a2a9c01050f2/public/apis/4358/versions/4394/files/root');
----
+
A prompt below the code tells you how to explore the API.
. Follow the prompt to create a new code cell. Hover over the cell to display the menu icon, and select *New Cell*.
. In the new code cell, and type the name of the API. For example, type tShirtOrderingService in the cell.
. Execute the code cell: Select the hamburger menu on the right of the cell and select *Execute.*

+
The following response containing the names of your resources appears:
+
----
function (a,b){var c=f(a||"",b||{}).replace(/^\/+/,"").split("/");return L(d.extend([],e,c),{},D)}
!client: Object
!config: Object
arguments: null
caller: null
length: 2
name: "g"
orders: Object
products: Object
prototype: g
----
+
. Expand !config to see the URL of the API.
+
. Add a code cell and enter the following function to post an order using the example order information in the RAML:
+
----
tShirtOrderingService.orders.post({"size": "M","email": "robin@mail.com","name": "Robin Pille","address1": "77 Geary St.","address2": "Apt 7","city": "San Francisco","stateOrProvince": "CA","country": "US","postalCode": "94131"})
----
+
. Select *Execute* from the cell's hamburger menu.
+
The response is:
+
----
Object {"body": Object, "status": 200, "headers": Object}
body: Object
headers: Object
status: 200
----
+
. Add a new code cell having the following contents:
+
----
var shirts = newTShirtOrderingService.orders.orderId('4321');
shirts;
----
+
. Observe the autocomplete choices from your RAML that are offered to you as you type. To add a line break within the cell, press **Shift + Enter**.

== Save and Share

Notebooks are saved to GitHub as gists. To save a gist, you must first log in to your GitHub account and authorize this application to write to it. Click the *save* icon.
