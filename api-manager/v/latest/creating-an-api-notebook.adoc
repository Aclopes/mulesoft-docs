= Creating an API Notebook
:keywords: api, notebook

API Notebook is a tool for building interactive tutorials and examples to present to users of your API. You can execute sequences of calls to an API for testing or other purposes. The Notebook is a web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace that enables live testing and exploring of APIs. A Notebook can generate an API client based on a RAML API definition, and through it you can perform authenticated live calls to an API, as shown in the link:/api-manager/tutorial-create-an-api-notebook[API Notebook tutorial].

In a code cell write the following method:

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
API.createClient(alias, url, options? cb?)
----

As you type this method, the API Notebook offers suggestions. These are the attributes you can use in it:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Req/Opt
|`alias` |The name with which you call this client from now on |Required
|`url` |A URL that directs to the API's RAML definition |Required
|`options` |A specification of default headers, a fallback body, or other option. Type the method in the notebook and place the cursor on this argument for more details. |Optional
|`cb` |Pass in a custom callback to run when the client has loaded |Optional
|===

The Notebook can call an existing API, as long as it's published behind an HTTP endpoint. Through the MockingService you can call mocked APIs that are almost an empty shell to test out your API design.

Notebooks are composed of two types of cells: *text* and *code*. Code cells are executable blocks of JavaScript, and text cells provide a neat way to display explanations and documentation. Text cells accept Markdown, so you can format your text to make it clear and readable. Any JavaScript is valid in code cells, you can even import JavaScript libraries and use functions from external libraries.

The design of the API Notebook follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming[literate programming] paradigm: Code should be human readable as well as executable.

== Creating a Notebook

There are two ways to create an API Notebook:

* Edit an API portal. Create the Notebook within the portal using the left navigation of the portal to add a new API Notebook. A line of code that creates the necessary API client for your RAML-based API is generated when you add the API Notebook.
* Use the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site to create a new Notebook. 
+
. Log in to your GitHub account.
. Authorize your application to write to the gist.
. Log into the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site using your GitHub account credentials. 
. Create the API Notebook.
. Click the *save* icon.

The API Notebook is stored as a link:https://gist.github.com[GitHub gist].

== Sharing API Notebooks

To share an API Notebook that you create in an API portal, share the API portal itself. Either make the portal public or give other users permissions to view it from the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page].

To share or embed your Notebook, click the *share* icon. You are offered two links, one for sharing the URL, the other for embedding the Notebook in a site.
