= Creating an API Notebook
:keywords: api, notebook

An API Notebook is a web-based tool for building interactive tutorials and examples in a JavaScript scripting workspace to present to users of your API. Users can execute sequences of calls to an API for testing or other purposes. 

The first step in creating a Notebook is accepting the default API client or creating a new one. A Notebook can generate an API client based on a RAML API definition, and through it you can perform authenticated live calls to an API, as shown in the link:/api-manager/tutorial-create-an-api-notebook[API Notebook tutorial]. You can create multiple clients to call different APIs in the same Notebook.  

Next, you write methods that call the clients to perform some task. With information from the RAML, API Notebook provides code completion hints as you type. Users can execute sequences of calls to an API for testing or other purposes.

If your Notebook is intended to be a tutorial for users of your API, write one JavaScript command per cell, and document each with a corresponding text cell. Walk users through the typical operations they may want to perform with your API, then invite them to change the parameters and explore the various options.

You can save an API Notebook as a gist in your GitHub account.

The design of the API Notebook follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming[literate programming] paradigm for making code readable. You combine code cells and text cells to write and explain the app.

Notebooks are composed of the following types of cells:

* Text
+
These cells accept markdown. Use text cells to include documentation about Notebook functions.
* Code
+
These cells accept JavaScript, including imported JavaScript libraries and functions from external libraries. Use code cells for executable blocks of JavaScript.

In a code cell write the following method:

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
API.createClient(alias, url, options? cb?)
----

As you type, the API Notebook offers suggestions. These are the attributes you can use in the createClient methos:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Req/Opt
|`alias` |The name with which you call this client from now on |Required
|`url` |A URL that directs to the API's RAML definition |Required
|`options` |A specification of default headers, a fallback body, or other option. Type the method in the notebook and place the cursor on this argument for more details. |Optional
|`cb` |Pass in a custom callback to run when the client has loaded |Optional
|===

The Notebook can call an existing API, as long as it's published behind an HTTP endpoint. Through the MockingService you can call mocked APIs that are almost an empty shell to test out your API design.

Notebooks are composed of two types of cells: *text* and *code*. Code cells are executable blocks of JavaScript, and text cells provide a neat way to display explanations and documentation. Text cells accept Markdown, so you can format your text to make it clear and readable. Any JavaScript is valid in code cells, you can even import JavaScript libraries and use functions from external libraries.

The design of the API Notebook follows the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming[literate programming] paradigm: Code should be human readable as well as executable.

== Creating a Notebook

There are two ways to create an API Notebook:

* Edit an API portal. Create the Notebook within the portal using the left navigation of the portal to add a new API Notebook. A line of code that creates the necessary API client for your RAML-based API is generated when you add the API Notebook.
* Use the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site to create a new Notebook. 
+
. Log in to your GitHub account.
. Authorize your application to write to the gist.
. Log into the link:https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/[API Notebook] site using your GitHub account credentials. 
. Create the API Notebook.
. Click the *save* icon.

The API Notebook is stored as a link:https://gist.github.com[GitHub gist].

== Sharing API Notebooks

To share an API Notebook that you create in an API portal, share the API portal itself. Either make the portal public or give other users permissions to view it from the link:/api-manager/tutorial-set-up-and-deploy-an-api-proxy#navigate-to-the-api-version-details-page[API version details page].

To share or embed your Notebook, click the *share* icon. You are offered two links, one for sharing the URL, the other for embedding the Notebook in a site.

To execute all code cells in your Notebook sequentially, click *Play*.
