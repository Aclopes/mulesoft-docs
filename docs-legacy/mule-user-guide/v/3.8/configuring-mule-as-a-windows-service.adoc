= Configuring Mule as a Windows NT Service
:keywords: anypoint, on premises, on premise, windows

[NOTE]
In Mule 3.8.0, the Tanuki wrapper was upgraded to a newer version, implying a change to the certificate by which the wrapper is signed. See link:/release-notes/mule-3.8.0-release-notes#enterprise-edition-library-changes[Mule 3.8.0 release notes concerning Tanuki Wrapper upgrade] for details on resolving compatibility issues.

If you want to install Mule as a Windows NT Service, type

[source]
----
mule install
----

Likewise, to remove Mule from your services, type:

[source]
----
mule remove
----

Once you have installed Mule as a service, you can invoke the service exactly as you did before, but with an additional parameter:

[source]
----
mule [start|stop|restart]
----

You can also use the Windows `net` utility:

[source]
----
net [start|stop] mule
----
