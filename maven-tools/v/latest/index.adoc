= About Mule Maven Plugin

The plugin allows you to:

* Deploy a Mule application to a local standalone server.
* Run integration tests in a local standalone deployment.
* Deploy Mule applications to Anypoint Runtime Manager.
* Deploy Mule applications to CloudHub.
* Deploy Mule applications to a local cluster.

The plugin supports both Community and Enterprise editions.

By default, your local Maven installation stores configuration files in the directory $HOME/.m2 ( ~/.m2 on Unix and Mac; C:\Documents and Settings\USER_NAME\.m2 on Windows). +
Keep in mind that in Linux or Mac .m2 is a hidden folder.
