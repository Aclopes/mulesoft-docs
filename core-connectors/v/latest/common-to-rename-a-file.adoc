. After adding the connector to your flow, select the *Rename* operation.
. Set up or select a configuration for the connector.
. Set the *Path* to the file that you want to write. If you do not provide a path, the operation will attempt to discover it from the local file attributes associated with the message. If the attempt is unsuccessful, you will receive an error message.
  ** Directory example: `invoices/current`
. Provide a *New Name* for the file (or directory).
  ** Directory example: `archived`
. Choose whether to *Overwrite* an existing version of the file (or directory) you are creating.
