= About Basic Security Filtering
:keywords: connectors

Add a listener, configure basic authentication, and then add a security filter to a flow. The filter can validate credentials using different providers, depending on some criteria, for example a user's role. You can supply a comma-separated list of security provider names.

You can optionally set a realm attribute, only if required by the remote servers.
