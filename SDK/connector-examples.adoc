= SDK Built Connector Structure

Let's use the PetStore connector to illustrate the extension code structure.


== What is in the PetStore Connector?

* *PetStoreConnector.java* - `Connector.java` file has the main class for the Extension. `@Extension` marks the `PetStoreConnector` class as the main class.
[NOTE]
`PetStoreConnector` specifies the locations of the *Operations*, *Connection Providers*, *Message Sources* and required/optional parameters.
* *PetStoreOperations.java* - a class for the operations the Petstore connector offers the end user.
* *PetStoreSource.java* - permits the connector to be used in the source side of a flow, as a message producer for the flow.
