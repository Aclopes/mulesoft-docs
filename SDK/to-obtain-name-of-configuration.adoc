= To Obtain a Configuration Name Programmatically

SDK takes care of XML parsing automatically. The downside of it is that you lose some degree of control regarding which information you can actually obtain.

One particular case is obtaining the name that a configuration has in the XML. Obtaining such a name is useful for logging purposes or to give descriptive names to any threads that the config starts.

To do that, use the `@ConfigName` annotation:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@ConfigName
private String configName;
----

That annotation can be used on fields of classes from which a configuration is derived.

[NOTE]
Must be of type `String`, does not require setters.
