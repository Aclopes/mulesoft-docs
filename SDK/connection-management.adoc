= Connection Management

For an extension which supports SaaS connections, it is important to define how the extension should use Mule to:

* *create the connection*
* *reconnect to the service*
* *handle connection retries*
* *support different connection mechanisms*
// oauth, http basic, etc?

The `ConnectionProvider` interface is responsible for creating, disconnecting, and describing the connection so the runtime can handle it.
