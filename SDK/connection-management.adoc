= About Connection Management

For an extension which supports connections to an external service or similar, you have to define how the extension should:

* create a connection
* reconnect to the service
* handle connection retries
* support different connection mechanisms
// oauth, http basic, etc?

The `ConnectionProvider` interface is responsible for creating, disconnecting, and describing the connection so the runtime can handle it.
