= Declaring an Extension

Declare an extension using the `@Extension` annotation on a Java class or interface.

[source,java]
----
@Extension(name = "my-extension", description = my very own Mule extension‚Äù)
----

[NOTE]
This marks a discoverable entry point for a `Describer`, which allows your module to be validated against the model for SDK modules.

== Next Steps

Extensions are composed of at least one configuration with parameters and one or many classes defining operations.

. Define the parameters governing your module's functionality
and define whether these are required or optional.
. link:/creating-configurations[Create Configurations] and
. link:/adding-operations[Add Operations]



[NOTE]
Consider the default, required and configuration details and define these in a global configuration in the `@Extension` class, or in a configuration class. .
