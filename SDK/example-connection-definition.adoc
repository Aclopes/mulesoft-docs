= Example Connection Definition

The interface that is extended by different connection types for the Sockets extension.

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
 * Represents a connection established with a socket
 *
 * @since 4.0
 */
public interface SocketConnection {

  /**
   * Disconnects the connection. Does nothing if the connection was not previously connected. If an error occur while
   * disconnecting, it will be logged with an ERROR level and the disconnection will continue.
   */
  void disconnect();

  /**
   * Establish a connection ready to be used.
   *
   * @throws ConnectionException if the connection couldn't be established
   */
  void connect() throws ConnectionException;

  /**
   * Validates socket's connection

== ListenerConnection for Sockets extension

`ListenerConnection` is a connection class that extends the `SocketConnection` interface above.

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
 * This kind of {@link SocketConnection} enables the {@link SocketListener} to await for new incoming connections and wraps each
 * one of those into a {@link SocketWorker} so they can run independently in their own thread.
 *
 * @since 4.0
 */
public interface ListenerConnection extends SocketConnection {

  /**
   * This method blocks until a new connection is received or timeout exception is thrown.
   *
   * @param sourceCallback used in the {@link SocketWorker} to deliver the new received messages
   * @return a {@link Runnable} that will represent a new received connection. The {@link Runnable} should be scheduled with an
   *         {@link Executor} in it's own thread.
   * @throws IOException if the connection was suddenly closed
   * @throws ConnectionException if the connection was closed and the cause was the invocation of
   *         {@link SocketConnection#disconnect()}
   */
  SocketWorker listen(SourceCallback<InputStream, SocketAttributes> sourceCallback) throws IOException, ConnectionException;
}
