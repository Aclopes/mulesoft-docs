= To Declare Imported Types

If an extension is required to use a type defined in a different module, then the developer will be able to declare that type as an imported type. Then, whenever that type is used, a reference to its original declaration will be provided in the XML support, instead of redefining the type as if it was declared in the current extension.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Extension(name = "petstore")
@Import(type = Ricin.class, from = HeisenbergExtension.class)
public class PetstoreExtension
----

When the import is declared, the user will be able to reference the original `heisenberg:ricin` element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<petstore:banned-items>
	<petstore:item>
<heisenberg:ricin microgramsPerKilo="22">
   <heisenberg:destination victim="Lidia" address="Stevia coffe shop" />
</heisenberg:ricin>
</petstore:item>
</petstore:banned-items>
