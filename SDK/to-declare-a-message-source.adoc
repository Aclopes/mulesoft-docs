= To Declare a Message Source for an Extension

_(Only for extensions that must generate messages for the flow)_


Implement the `Source` class, which takes two generics:

* one for the type of the generated event payload and,
* another for the type of the attributes

.Example implementation in the HTTP Extension
include::defining-sources.adoc[tags=msg-source-example]


== To Signal the Message Source Emits a Response

Annotate the class with `@EmitsResponse`. The runtime does not validate that a response is actually emitted.

== To Obtain a Response From the Flow

Declare methods annotated with `@OnSuccess` or `@OnError`.
