= To Declare Operations

Operations are declared in a similar way as configurations.

. From the Extension main class use the `@Operations` annotation to point to a class which holds the operations.
. Code your logic in various methods of this class.
* Every _public_ method of the `@Operations` class is assumed to be a valid operation, therefore there is no need to use any annotation.
* Any public method you do not want exposed as an operation should be annotated with `@Ignore`
* Every method argument is translated as a `ParameterModel`
//MG need to mention ParameterModel? What does this model allow Extensions API to do?
* Arguments of each operation (`@Operations` class method) can be annotated with `@Optional` and with `@Expression`

== Example @Operations Declaration
