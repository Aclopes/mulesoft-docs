Mule 3 Connectors Migration to Mule 4

DNU for public: Testing Mule 4 connectors using Mule 3 CTF
Functional tests run using CTF on Mule 4 M3
Mule 4 SDK Modules do not have a testing framework at the current time.
Refresher: Generates a valid Mule application, and makes a request to a new Mule running the application with these extensions.

4x Differences from 3x

ConnectionProvider

In Mule 4 you have a client, configuration and connection providers. The parameters that are in the ConnectionProvider is front and center.

The Default Configuration is implicit in the class that contains the Operations.

Before we implemented abstract configuration classes to support as many configuration types were supported by connector. Those configuration classes had to have the @ConnectionManagement annotation. Now we have @ConnectionProviders annotation on the @ConnectionProviders class.

Mule 4
You can define @Operations in the connection provider level or the Extension level, as opposed to in DevKit you could reference the operations/processors
//confirm with MG

Mule 4 Metadata builders
//talk to Cora Epidata, sync with MG
