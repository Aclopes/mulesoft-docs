= SDK for Mule 4
:keywords: devkit, development, features, architecture


Create Mule 4 modules using the *Mule SDK*, the standard framework used to build components, connectors, message sources, and more, for use in Mule 4 applications. The framework provides Java annotations to assist the developer in the work of writing the module.

Mule 4 integration applications use Mule 4 modules. These modules are built using the SDK. The Extensions API is the mechanism that Mule 4 runtime uses to manage module functionality and resources for a running Mule 4 application, to execute any given module operation according to the SDK module developer's definition as coded/annotated in Java.

[IMPORTANT]
*Anypoint Connector DevKit*-built connectors work out of the box with Mule 3.5.3 to Mule 3.9.x. You must use *SDK* to build Anypoint Connectors for Mule 4. SDK is an annotations-based framework allowing you as the developer to organize and build features for the module. For a complete list of SDK annotations, see the link:/annotation-reference[Annotation Reference].

== What is a Module in Mule 4 terms?

A module is the Java code that is written and compiled to function in an integration app designed to run on Mule 4. The module defines a contract between Mule and a resource, for example a cloud service or API, enabling ease of access to the service for the Mule app/integration developer, for example by providing the user the settings required for connection to the service.

The developer uses the Mule 4 SDK framework to code the module providing the necessary parameters for all desired module functionality in specific classes. The developer must annotate the classes according to the predefined SDK model. In this way the developer can expose to the end user/app developer the module functionality via Anypoint Studio or browser design tools in a predictable manner.

The end user of the module is the Mule 4 integration developer. The integration developer is responsible for defining at application design time the data to be passed through the module at application run time, so that for example the connection(s) settings and the operation(s) to be carried out are correct.

The module class is the entry point that Mule interacts with and references these classes:

- Extension main class - Contains generic information such as the name, description, version, etc. It also contains the list of available configuration models plus the operations, sources and connection providers which are globally available all across the extension.
- Configuration
- Operations

[NOTE]

== How do I structure my module code?

Here are some noteworthy guidelines for module development; these are general and not exhaustive.

. First declare your module/extension and its configuration(s). Use the `@Extension`, `@Configurations`, and `@Configuration` annotation to declare your extension and its configurations.
+
////
[source,java,linenums]
----
@Extension(name = "heisenberg", description = ”heisenberg extension”)
public class HeisenbergExtension
{
----

Or, you may choose to place the `@Configurations` annotation elsewhere.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Extension(name = "heisenberg", description = ”heisenberg extension”, version = "1.0")
@Configurations({BlueHeisenbergConfig.class, PseudoEfedrinHeisenbergConfig.class})
public class HeisenbergExtension
{
}

@Configuration(name = "blue")
public class BlueHeisenberg extends HeisenbergExtension
{
}


@Configuration(name = "pseudo")
public class PseudoEfedrinHeisenberg extends HeisenbergExtension
{
}
----
////
[NOTE]
`@Extension` marks a discoverable entry point for discovery and validation of the module for use with Mule. Modules are composed of at least one configuration and a set of operations, whose behavior may be dynamic, that is, dependent on the configuration used. +
. Annotate the parameters used for the configurations, with `@Parameter`, optionally grouping them with `@ParameterGroup`. By default, "expressions" written in Mule expression language (DataWeave) are supported for use in parameters. Otherwise, you must specify they are not supported.
. Create a class for operations and annotate the class with `@Operations`. Each class method would be an operation.
. Support a mapping of the module functionality to an XML structure, by decorating the module class with `@Xml` and other supporting annotations.

Note there are guidelines that you must follow in addition to these.

== What is a Configuration?

A configuration is a set of configurable attributes which affect the behavior of the module. All modules are required to have at least one configuration, but can also define as many other configurations as needed. Different configurations might not only provide a different set of parameters, but also specify their own set of operations, sources and connection providers which are only available when using that configuration.

An extension can be asked for its configuration in which case it returns a collection of them. The first element of that collection will be the default configuration. The other elements (if any) will be the optional configurations alphabetically sorted by name. All configurations must have a name.

== What are the guidelines for coding Configurations and Operations?

* Configurations and operations must be defined in different classes
* If the extension provides several configurations, each one must be defined in its own class, although all of them will be required to belong to have a common ancestor class and/or implement the same interface when defined at the same level
* Operations can be defined in a more flexible way. They can all be defined in the same class, be spread across several classes, or even have a one operation per class model.

== How does Mule 4 interact with a Module?

*Extensions API* is the set of interfaces and classes that not only centralizes all validations and instantiating logic, for the module. At deployment of a Mule application, the Extensions API handles communication between the SDK-built module and the Mule 4 runtime, effectively decoupling their respective tasks. The Extensions API has no dependency on Mule core.

=== Connector Architecture

Connectors operate within Mule applications, which are built up from Mule Flows, and external resources, which are the targeted resources.

image:DevKitOverviewArchitecture.png[DevKitOverviewArchitecture]

A Mule connector has two operational sides. The Mule-facing side communicates with a resource’s target-facing client side to enable content to travel between the Mule applications, and the external target-facing resource.

==== Mule-Facing Functionality

From the Mule-facing side, a connector consists of:

* *Main Java class*. Java code that you annotate with the `@Connector` attribute. See the link:http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-devkit/[Anypoint DevKit API Reference] for information about Anypoint Connector DevKit annotations. See  link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation[Java annotations] for information on how annotations work. 
* *Connector attributes*. Properties of the `@Connector` class that you annotate with the `@Configurable` attribute. 
* *Methods*. Functionality that you annotate with the `@Processor` attribute.

Additional annotations define authentication-related functionality, such as connection management. Annotations allow you to control the layout of the Anypoint Studio dialogues for the connector as well. The data model and exceptions that either raise or propagate are also Mule-facing classes.

DevKit generates a scaffold connector when you create your Anypoint Connector project in Studio. This scaffold connector includes the `@Connector` class, the `@Configurable` attributes, the `@Processor` methods, and authentication logic to build out your connector.

==== Target-Facing Functionality

The target facing or client facing side of a connector depends on the client technology that enables access to the resource. This functionality consists of a class library and one or more classes that `@Connector` classes use to access client functionality. This functionality is called the client class.

The client class in turn generally depends on other classes to actually implement calls to the targeted resource. Depending on your target, some of these classes may be generated or provided for you. For example, if you have a Java client library, or are working with a SOAP or REST services, most of the client code is implemented there. In other cases, you have to write the code yourself.

== Coding a Connector

DevKit lets you build connectors from scratch. Before creating your own connector, check the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&sortBy=name[Anypoint Exchange] for available connectors. The connectors page also lists Community open source connectors that let you contribute to the growing community of public connector development.

==== Connector Data Model

The data model for the connector consists of the objects passed into and out of the exposed operations. While many Web services accept and return XML or JSON data, a proper Mule connector must translate the data format the client uses into Java objects – either POJOs or key-value maps which represent the data objects sent to, and returned from, the target. (Returning raw XML or JSON responses to Mule is one marker for an immature, improperly implemented connector.)

==== REST Versus SOAP

REST simplifies access to HTTP using POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE calls to provide access to creating, getting, putting, and deleting information on a resource.

DevKit currently provides a strategy for link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.8/creating-a-connector-for-a-restful-api-using-jersey[Creating a Connector for a RESTful API Using Jersey] to build a REST API-supported connector.

SOAP is a traditional means of communicating with a resource and requires a WSDL file, which is an XML file that specifies all aspects of a Java class’s structure, methods, properties, and documentation. SOAP is an industry standard with tools for governance, building, and schema information. DevKit provides a tools that helps building a connector using a WSDL file. 

==== DevKit 3.8 Example Default Connector

The following is an example of the starting `@Connector` and `@Configuration` classes that DevKit 3.8 creates:

[source, java, linenums]
----

package org.mule.modules.demojdk;

import org.mule.api.annotations.Config;

@Connector(name="demo-jdk", friendlyName="DemoJDK")
public class DemoJDKConnector {


        @Config
    ConnectorConfig config;

    /**
     * Custom processor
     *
     * @param friend Name to be used to generate a greeting message.
     * @return A greeting message
     */
    @Processor
    public String greet(String friend) {
        /*
         * MESSAGE PROCESSOR CODE GOES HERE
         */
        return config.getGreeting() + " " + friend + ". " + config.getReply();
    }

    public ConnectorConfig getConfig() {
        return config;
    }

    public void setConfig(ConnectorConfig config) {
        this.config = config;
    }
}
----

The DevKit 3.8 `@Configuration` class is as follows:

[source, java, linenums]
----
package org.mule.modules.demojdk.config;

import org.mule.api.annotations.components.Configuration;
import org.mule.api.annotations.Configurable;
import org.mule.api.annotations.param.Default;

@Configuration(friendlyName = "Configuration")
public class ConnectorConfig {

    /**
     * Greeting message
     */
    @Configurable
    @Default("Hello")
    private String greeting;

    /**
     * Reply message
     */
    @Configurable
    @Default("How are you?")
    private String reply;

    /**
     * Set greeting message
     *
     * @param greeting the greeting message
     */
    public void setGreeting(String greeting) {
        this.greeting = greeting;
    }

    /**
     * Get greeting message
     */
    public String getGreeting() {
        return this.greeting;
    }

    /**
     * Set reply
     *
     * @param reply the reply
     */
    public void setReply(String reply) {
        this.reply = reply;
    }

    /**
     * Get reply
     */
    public String getReply() {
        return this.reply;
    }
}
