= To Add Operations to an Extension


toc::[]


== Before Proceeding

Since operations frequently make use of configuration parameters, make sure you have already:

* Created the Extension class
* Added any global attributes
* Created a configuration with its specific user configurable attributes


== To Declare Operations

Declare the operations at the extension if they are global operations. Otherwise declare them at the configuration level. Define operations in one or several classes. Mark operation classes with `@Operations`.
