== What can a connector do?

Connectors in Mule applications receive or send messages between Mule and one or more external sources, such as files, databases, or web services. A connector in a Mule flow can act as an:

* inbound endpoint to produce a Mule message
* message processor that performs an operation
* recipient of the final Mule message payload data

== What are the types of connectors?

Connectors in Mule flows are either *endpoint-based* or *operation-based*.

=== Endpoint-Based Connectors

Endpoint-based connectors follow either a one-way or request-response exchange pattern and are often (but not always) named and based around a standard data communication protocol, such as FTP and SMTP.

Endpoint-based connectors are configured as either inbound or outbound endpoints in a flow. Inbound endpoints serve as a message source for a flow. Outbound endpoints can occur mid-flow or at the end of flows, and send information to external systems.

=== Operation-Based Connectors

Operation-based connectors follow an information exchange pattern based on the operation that you select and are often (but not always) named and based around one or more specific third-party APIs.

When you add an operation-based connector to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

The XML element of the connector differs according to the operation that you select, taking the form `<connectorName>:<operation>`. For example, `sfdc:query` or `sfdc:upsert-bulk`. The remaining configuration attributes or child elements are determined by the operation that you select.

== How do I configure a connector?

Some connectors require that connection information such as the username, password, and security tokens be stored in a simple container for this information, called the link:/mule-user-guide/v/latest[global element]. When you configure a connector's *connector configuration*, you are essentially creating a global element which is available to all instances of that connector. Many connectors of the same type in an application can *reference the global element from the connector configuration*.

[NOTE]
For operation-based connectors, connector configuration is mandatory, but for most endpoint-based connectors it is optional. 

Remember that the global element you configure in Anypoint Studio is called a *connector configuration*. The corresponding XML tags are `<connectorName>:config` for operation-based connectors and `<connectorName>:connector` for endpoint-based connectors.

== HTTP Connector Example

This example shows an HTTP connector, which is operation-based. You can  configure this connector as both a listener for receiving inbound requests or as a request connector for making outbound requests. The HTTP connector requires a global connector configuration that specifies its connection attributes.

== JMS Connector Example

This example shows an endpoint-based JMS connector for the JMS transport. You can  configure this connector as an inbound endpoint in a flow. The JMS endpoint includes a mandatory reference to a global connector configuration which contains the connection parameters.

== Salesforce Connector Example

This example shows a Salesforce connector, which is operation-based. You can  configure this connector to create a new contact in Salesforce based on the payload pulled from a file endpoint. The Salesforce connector includes a mandatory reference to a global connector configuration that contains the connection parameters.
