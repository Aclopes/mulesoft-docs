= About Modules and Connectors

A module is a package of functionality for Mule. It can combine event sources, perform operations and offer a number configurations, each of which may support a subset of operations.

//COMBAK: Check if it makes sense to add other stuff about connectors in here.
Modules that allow you to configure connections to other services are also referred to as Connectors.

// REVIEW: Determine if this is technically accurate
Importantly, *modules* don't have to have any Mule-specific code; they can simply be POJOs, Spring beans, Java beans, Groovy scripts, or web services containing the business logic for processing data. Components can even be developed in other languages such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP. Mule’s catalog of *components* support the most commonly used Enterprise Integration Patterns.

// == DataWeave
//
// Dataweave is the primary language used for formulating expressions in Mule, allowing you to access, manipulate, and use information from the message and its environment. 
//
// At runtime, Mule evaluates expressions while executing a flow to:
//
// * Extract information from the Mule event.
// * Restructure or manipulate any part of the Mule event.
// // REVIEW: Define if DW can be used to filter muleEvents.
// * Define a filter, to allow certain *Mule events* to continue to be processed in a *flow* based on certain criteria.
// * Set or manipulate a value in the message attribute, the payload, or a variable.
// * Perform an operation on information in the Mule event, application, Mule instance, or server.
