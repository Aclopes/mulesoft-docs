= About the Choice Router

The Choice flow control component dynamically routes execution based on the contents of the input. It adds conditional processing to a flow, similar to an if/then/else code block in most programming languages.

A Choice flow control component uses expressions to evaluate the content of the input, it then routes to the first option that matches the expression (evaluates to true).

* When blocks are executed when its corresponding condition is matched.

* An optional Else block is executed only if none of the When conditions are matched.





You can name conditions, this only has an effect of the UI
