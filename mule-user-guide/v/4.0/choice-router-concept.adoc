= About the Choice Router

The Choice flow control component dynamically routes execution based on the contents of the input. It adds conditional processing to a flow, similar to an if/then/else code block in most programming languages.

A choice flow control uses expressions to evaluate the content of the input, it then routes to the first option that matches the expression (evaluates to true). You can also add an optional default choice (else), to rout to in case none of expressions evaluate to true.




<choice>
   <when expr " ">
   <otherwise>

   <when>
<choice>



To configure the choice flow control, you need to determine the following message routing details:

What content the choice flow router evaluates to determine routing

Number of routing options for the choice flow control

What processing Mule performs for each routing option
