= Error Handling

SDK enables the extension developer to declare the *error types* that can be thrown by the extension and where they can be thrown, for example at the operation or configuration levels.
//what are the levels at which the errors can be thrown at runtime
* Map the existing Java exceptions to Mule errors
* Declare which components can throw errors, including the type of the errors

== Declaring Error Types and Where Errors are Thrown


Mule `ErrorTypes` can be a part of a namespace. You can declare a specialization or origin of this error.
//"can be"? are their regular Mule errortypes and those customized by module?

The module namespace, by default, should be the moduleâ€™s namespace. The module developer can customize the `ErrorType` or throw errors as long as the proper namespace is specified.
//confirm the above, but where is ns specified?

As a consequence, all the declared errors inside a module would be part of the same namespace, so the module developer should, upon specifying the correct namespace, worry only about the error type.
//assuming module=extension?
//can the Mule error type be customized via the module. Where is a module's namespace identified in the code?

[NOTE]
Example: If the Slack module declares the `NOT_FOUND` error for a certain operation, this will be registered as `SLACK:NOT_FOUND` error.
//all-caps?

The purpose of the restriction on error declaration is to impose a standardized way to expose module errors and also ensure a consistent experience for the developer handling errors in a Mule application. For a module developer, this provides a streamlined development experience. For the Mule app developer, a consistent experience across all modules.
