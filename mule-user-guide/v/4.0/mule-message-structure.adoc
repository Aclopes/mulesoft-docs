= Mule Message Structure
:keywords: studio, components, elements, message, mule message, architecture

// [NOTE]
// This document examines the Mule message in the context of a *flow* rather than a *batch job*. Please see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/batch-processing[Batch Processing] for more information about how messages in a batch job are broken up and processed as *records*.

The *Mule message* is the data that passes through link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/using-flows-for-service-orchestration[flows] inside your Mule application.

It consists of two main parts:

* The message *attributes*, which contains metadata from and attributes of the Mule message.
* The message *payload*, which contains the core information of the Mule message.

// [TIP]
// If you're ever in doubt about the structure of the message in a given step of the flow, you can easily check by using the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/using-the-datasense-explorer[DataSense Explorer].

== Attributes and Variables

The metadata contained in the message header consists of *attributes* which provide process related information about the message. Contained within the message object, *variables* represent data about a message. 

Attributes and variables share a common format: each individual attribute or variable has a *name* and a *value*. The name is how you refer to the attribute or variable in Mule, and the value is the information stored within it.

* *Attributes* send metadata along with a message in order to facilitate processing and avoid errors when the message crosses a _transport barrier_.

[TIP]
--
We say a message goes through a _transport barrier_ when it goes through an endpoint (such as an HTTP endpoint), that causes the message to be serialized to later be deserialized when it arrives at the destination endpoint. +
In this scenario, the message *payload* does not change, but the *Mule message object* is different.
--
+
* *Variables* are user-defined metadata about a message. Variables are temporary pieces of information about a message that are meant to be used by the application that is processing it, rather than passed along with the message to its destination.

Generally, variables are more likely to be set by users, whereas attributes are more likely to be set and invoked by systems. However, there are no strict rules about how attributes and variables should be used.

=== Setting and Using Attributes and Variables

Mule includes three message processors you can use to set, copy or remove outbound attributes and variables on a message in a flow. When you include one of these transformers in your flow, Mule adds, copies or removes metadata to the message header or object. (There is a fourth message processor: the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/record-variable[Record Variable Transformer] can set or remove variables on a record in a batch. This section, however, focuses only on message processors which act upon messages.) 

For example, you may want to add a attribute to a message to set an HTTP transport header on your message. Alternatively, if your flow looks up an account number associated with a user, you may want to add a variable to your message to store the account number as metadata on the message. The table below describes these three message processors: *attribute Transformer*, *Variable Transformer*, and *Session Variable Transformer*. 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|  |Attribute |Variable
|*Use* |Use a *attribute Transformer* to set, remove, or copy *attributes* on the outbound scope of a message. |Use a *Variable Transformer* to set or remove a *flow* *variable* on the message, tied to the current flow.
|*Persistence* |Once a message hits an outbound-endpoint, all attributes in the outbound scope are sent with the message, in the form of transport-specific metadata (HTTP headers for an HTTP outbound-endpoint, for example). |Variables set with a variable transformer persist only for the current flow and cannot cross the transport barrier.
|===

As an example, the following flow sets an outbound attribute – a timestamp – on a message. 

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

*Value* is set to the `#[server.dateTime]` expression:

....
[tab,title="XML Editor or Standalone"]
....
[source, xml, linenums]
----
include::_sources/mule-message-structure_1.xml[]
----
....
------

To access the attribute or variable that you have set on a message earlier in a flow, or in a different flow in the application, use a MEL expression.  

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Type |Description
|Outbound attribute |Sets, removes, or copies a attribute transformer.

*MEL Example*: `#[messsage.outboundattributes]`
|Inbound attribute |Specifies inbound attributes.

*MEL Example*: `#[messsage.inboundattributes]`
|Session Variable |Sets or removes a Session Variable Transformer.

*MEL Example*: `#[sessionVars]`
|Variable |Sets or removes a Variable Transformer, or copies a Variable.

*MEL Example*: `#[flowVars]`
|===

For example, if you want to route messages according to the timeStamp attribute you added to the header earlier in processing, you can use an expression in a choice router to access the outbound attribute using `message.outboundattributes` and route accordingly. Refer to the example below, where the following expression accesses the timeStamp attribute and evaluates to the value of the attribute (that is, the time stamped on the message)

*MEL Expression*:

[source]
----
#[message.outboundattributes.timeStamp]
----

*Example*:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
    <when expression="#[message.outboundattributes.timeStamp]">
        <logger level="INFO" doc:name="Logger"/>
    </when>
    <otherwise>
    ...
    </otherwise>
</choice>
----

Similarly, once you have set a session variable, you can access it using the **`sessionVars`** map in a Mule expression. For example, if you have set a session variable with the name "`SVname`" and the value "`SVvalue`", you can later invoke that session variable using the expression `#[sessionVars['SVname']]`, which evaluates to `SVvalue`.  To access a variable, use `flowVars` in place of `sessionVars` in the preceding expression.

== Message Payload

The message payload is the most important part of the Mule message because it contains the data your Mule application processes. You may apply metadata in the message header or message object to communicate information about your message or secure it from being tampered with, but the core of the message – the data you are transporting – is the reason the message exists in the first place. 

The payload doesn't necessarily stay the same as it travels through a flow. Various message processors in a Mule flow can affect the payload along the way by setting it, enriching, or transforming it into a new format. You can also extract information from a payload within a flow using a MEL expression.

=== Setting a Message Payload

Use a *Set Payload* message processor to completely replace the content of the message's payload. Enter a literal string or a Mule expression that defines the new payload that Mule should set. The following example replaces the payload with a string that reads "Hello, my friend!".

=== Enriching a Message Payload

In some cases, you may wish to call an external resource and use the response to enrich the message payload, rather than replace it. To do so, you can use a *Message Enricher* scope (or wrapper) to encapsulate one or more message processors which perform the task of fetching the information. Once obtained, Mule adds to, or enriches, the message payload with the result of the call to the resource.

== Viewing the Mule Message

In Studio, you can visualize the structure of a Mule Message at any given point of the flow. All you have to do is select an element in the flow and  click the *DataSense* icon.

image:datasenseexplorericon.png[icon]

This opens the *DataSense explorer*, and displays both the structure of the message that enters the element, and the structure of the message that leaves it. This is useful to know the names of variables and attributes that are available at that point, as well as the payload's internal structure.

image:metadata-explorer.png[metadata]

[TIP]
When the Mule Message relies on inbound requests, information about the initial message structure won't be known by Studio and so won't be displayed in the DataSense explorer. If you know what the structure needs to be like, you can input this information into the *Metadata* tab of the inbound connector. Thanks to that, the DataSense explorer infers the message structure for any of the elements that follow that input.
