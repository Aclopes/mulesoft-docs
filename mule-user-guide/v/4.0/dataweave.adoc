== Overview

The link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-language-introduction[DataWeave Language] is a powerful, Mule-specific language that you can use to access, evaluate and transform the data in a Mule message. Tightly integrated to the Mule Runtime and Anypoint Studio, and usable from within virtually every message processor in Mule, DataWeave enables you to quickly and elegantly filter, route, or otherwise act upon the different parts of the Mule event object. It can be used lightly as an expression language to simply reference values or invoke methods, or it can also be used as a fully fledged scripting language to construct complex data transformations that include functions and recursion.

DataWeave supports a variety of transformations: simple *one-to-one*, *one-to-many* or *many-to-one* mappings from an assortment of data structures, and can complete more elaborate mappings including normalization, grouping, joins, partitioning, pivoting and filtering. With DataWeave and Mule Expression Language (MEL), you can take your application's data transformation ability to the next level.

[TIP]
====
In Mule runtime 4.x, DataWeave replaces the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language[Mule Expression Language (MEL)]. In Mule runtime versions 3.x, MEL is the _de facto_ expression language whilst, DataWeave is available as a specialized tool that can be used within the Transform Message component or via a specific link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mel-dataweave-functions[MEL functions].

For the simple use case of extracting a value from the Mule event, DataWeave syntax remains identical to that of MEL, so you might find that scripts from older versions will work in Mule 4 without any changes, even though they're technically being processed via a different language engine.

If you still need to use MEL, you can include it to your projects by adding the compatibility package.
====

[INFO]
DataWeave supports link:/anypoint-studio/v/7/datasense[DataSense], which allows you to leverage metadata from connectors, schemas and sample documents in order to design your transformations more easily. DataSense assists you in design time by providing a live stream of content types while you are coding, scaffolding your mappings to help make writing transformations fast and easy.


== DataWeave Expression Essentials

It's important to know that DataWeave has not always been the _de facto_ expression language Mule uses. Prior to version 4.0.0, the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-expression-language[Mule Expression Language (MEL)] was mostly used for most needs, whilst DataWeave was reserved for only carrying out transformations.

Mule 4.0.0 put DataWeave front and center, implementing a single set of syntax rules. DataWeave expressions are written according to the following format: `#[expression]`.

DataWeave expressions are deeply influenced by their context. Metadata about input and output data – its format, structure, etc – helps shape the behavior of your transformation. The DataWeave header allows you to specify custom properties, but this part of the expression is *optional*, as these properties default to what fits the metadata best.

If you're already familiar with Java, learning DataWeave is not difficult. That said, it's important to comprehend some Mule-specific details _before_ you learn how to apply DataWeave expressions in your application.

. *Understand the Mule message structure.* Because you use DataWeave to act upon the contents of a Mule message object (payload, properties and variables), you first need to understand the basic structure of the message. If you are not already familiar with it, read about the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/mule-message-structure[Mule message structure].

. *Understand how to see the contents of the Mule message.* To be able to act upon it, you need to be able to figure out what type of data the message contains. Is the payload an array? Does the message contain a flow variable? What attributes exist? The link:/getting-started/mule-message[Mule Message Tutorial] describes the tools you can use to see inside the message, so that you know how to use DataWeave expressions to manipulate the data. Note that as of Mule 4.0.0, the Mule event structure is radically different, making it a lot simpler.

After having absorbed this material, you are ready to begin learning about DataWeave basic syntax, and start using expressions in your application. 


== Using DataWeave

Based on information Mule extracts from the message or its environment at runtime, Mule evaluates expressions to complete different types of tasks:

* *Extract* information: 
** `#[payload]`
** `#[attributes.propertyName]`
** `#[myVariableName]`
** `#[sizeOf payload.shoppingCart.items]`
+
[TIP]
For a full reference about how to extract different values with Dataweave, see link:/mule-user-guide/dataweave-for-extracting-values[Dataweave for extracting values].

* *Evaluate* conditions:
** `#[payload.age > 21]`
** `#[attributes.locale  ==  'en_us']`
+
The example below evaluates part of the payload to forward requests to different flows.
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<choice>
  <when expression="#[payload.purchaseType == 'book']">
    <flow-ref name="flow1"/>
  </when>
  <when expression="#[payload.purchaseType == 'mp3']">
   <flow-ref name="flow2"/>
  </when>
</choice>
----

* *Transform* the message.
** `#[payload: arrayWithSizes -- "XXL" ]`
** `#[payload.name: upper payload.name]`
+
[source,DataWeave, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
shirts: payload map {
    size: upper $.size,
    count: $.count
}
filter $.count > 0
----

== The Transform Message Component

Use the *Transform Message* component, which allows you to use the language to query and transform data through DataWeave. Any mappings you perform through the graphical interface will be expressed in DataWeave code in real-time.

* link:link:/anypoint-studio/v/7/using-dataweave-in-studio[Graphically map] fields by dragging one attribute to another, just like you were able to with the now deprecated DataMapper
* Implement this component through link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-xml-reference[XML]

[TIP]
====
If you have projects that employ the deprecated DataMapper, a migration tool is now included in Studio, which assists in converting a DataMapper map to DataWeave: Right click on a DataMapper, select *Migrate to DataWeave*, and follow the instructions. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave-migrator[DataWeave Migrator].
====


== Auto-Complete

If you are configuring a field that supports expressions and need help with syntax, you can access DataWeave suggestions by one of two methods.

* Place your cursor inside the brackets in a field that has `#[]` pre-populated for you, then press Ctrl + Space Bar.
* Enter `#[` to open a new DataWeave expression and display suggestions, as shown below.
+

+
[WARNING]
Note that the autocomplete functionality described here works in the *Visual Editor only*. Although Studio's XML tab does offer some autocomplete options, the suggestions there are limited by Eclipse and are not based on DataSense or DataWeave.

== Additional Tips

* DataWeave performs link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_coercion[type coercion] at runtime. 
* When writing in Studio's XML editor, you cannot use double quotes to express String literals, because DataWeave expressions already appear enclosed in double quotes in configuration files. Instead, you can either: +
** use single quotes                   `('expression')`
** escape quotes with &quot;      `(&quot;expression&quot;)`
** escape quotes with \u0027      `(\u0027expression\u0027)`
+
If you're writing on Studio's visual editor, Studio transforms double quotes into escaped quotes `(&quot;) `in the XML view.
