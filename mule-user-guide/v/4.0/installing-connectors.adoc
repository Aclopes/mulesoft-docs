== Install a Connector via Anypoint Studio


You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in link:/getting-started/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].  

If a connector or a particular connector version is not in Anypoint Exchange, you can install the connector through Anypoint Studio:

. Verify if a connector is already installed by clicking *Help* > *Installation Details* and searching for the connector. Click *Close*.
. Click *Help* > *Install New Software*.
. Set *Work with* to *Anypoint Connectors Update Site*.
. Expand a category and click the checkbox for the connector you want to install.
. Click *Next*, *Next*, *I accept the terms of the license agreement*, *Finish*, and restart Studio when prompted.
. From a Mule Project in Studio, search for the connector and drag it to the Canvas.

[[uninstall-conn-studio]]
== Uninstall a Connector via Anypoint Studio

. Under the *Anypoint Studio* menu, select *About Anypoint Studio*.  +
image:AboutAnypointStudio.png[AboutAnypointStudio]

. In the *About Anypoint Studio* window, click *Installation Details* to display a list of the connectors you have installed on your instance of Anypoint Studio.
. In the *Installed Software* tab, select the line item you wish to uninstall, then click *Uninstall*.

[TIP]
To uninstall more than one item, click to select the first line item, then hold down the `Ctrl` key (PC) or `command` key (Mac) as you click other line items.
. Click *Finish* to uninstall the item(s) you selected.

=== Uninstall a Connector via Maven

To uninstall a connector, remove the Maven dependency for that connector from your `pom.xml` file.

=== How Anypoint Studio Manages Connectors in Mule Apps

When you add a connector to a flow, Studio automatically adds all of its dependencies (including `.jar` files) to your project's link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_(Java)[classpath]. Mule manages each connector's dependencies as an Eclipse user library. Because Studio adds a connector's dependencies to your project's classpath, you can reference connector classes within other projects in your Anypoint Studio instance.

In an Anypoint Studio project that is built with Maven support, when you add a connector to your flow, Studio automatically adds the dependency (and the inclusion element to the maven-mule-plugin, if needed) to your pom file. Then, it refreshes your project dependencies based on the new contents of your pom file, and the connector (and its transitive dependencies)  appears referenced in your project's "Referenced Libraries" section as a set of references to .jar files in your local m2 repository.

Refer to link:/getting-started/index[Deploying Mule Applications] for more information on managing your user libraries in Studio.

=== Adding Connector Dependencies to Project Classpath via Studio

Complete the following procedure to manually add connector dependencies to your project's classpath in Studio.

. In the *Package Explorer* pane, right-click on your project's name, then select *Build Path* > *Add Libraries*.

. In the *Add Libraries* wizard, select *Anypoint Connector Dependencies*, and click *Next*.

. Check the boxes associated with the connector dependencies you wish to add to your project's classpath.

. Click *Finish* to add the dependencies.

=== Managing Connector as Maven Dependency

If you are installing a connector as a Maven dependency, ensure that you complete the following three steps for each connector:

. To make any connector module available to a Mule application, first add the following repositories to your `pom.xml` file:
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>mulesoft-releases</id>
        <name>MuleSoft Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/releases/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
    <repository>
        <id>mulesoft-snapshots</id>
        <name>MuleSoft Snapshot Repository</name>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/snapshots/</url>
        <layout>default</layout>
    </repository>
</repositories>
----
+
. Add the module as a dependency to your project, replacing `insert-artifactId-here` with the artifactId of the specific module you are adding and replacing RELEASE with the version of this module.
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
    <artifactId>insert-artifactId-here</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----
+
. If you plan to use this module inside a Mule application, you need to add it to the packaging process. As such, the final zip file which contains your flows and Java code also contains this module and its dependencies. Add a special inclusion to the configuration of the Mule-Maven plugin for this module, replacing `insert-artifactId-here` with the artifactId of the specific module you are adding.
+
[source, xml, linenums]

<plugin>
    <groupId>org.mule.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-mule-plugin</artifactId>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <excludeMuleDependencies>false</excludeMuleDependencies>
        <inclusions>
            <inclusion>
                <groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>
                <artifactId>insert-artifactId-here</artifactId>

        </inclusions>
