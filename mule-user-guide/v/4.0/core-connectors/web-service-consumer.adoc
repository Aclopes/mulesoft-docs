The Web Service Consumer connector configures a connection to a SOAP service using a 
WSDL file that you supply. Use this connector when you have a WSDL and no other 
Anypoint Connector works for the service.

This connector consists of a configuration with a single connection provider that returns instances of connections based on a WSDL definition, returns a specific service and port and, optionally, the service address (we take the one bound in the binding as default).

The connector is based on link:http://cxf.apache.org/docs/why-cxf.html[Apache CXF], 
which handles all the SOAP message parsing and building.

The web service consumer has a single operation, the *Consume* operation that provides all the available operations for the given connection and only accepts a SOAP message that is valid for the selected SOAP operation.

[NOTE]
As with the old module, the underlying transport can be configured. By default, it uses HTTP with a simple configuration, however both JMS and HTTP can be configured.
//MG what do we mean by simple configuration?
