= To Make an HTTP Request

. In an empty flow, select an HTTP connector to trigger the flow.
. Set up the listener configuration: 
+
* In Configuration Name, accept the default name HTTP Listener. 
* In Connection, accept the default protocol HTTP.
* Set the host and port. For example, host = 0.0.0.0 and port = 8081. 
* Accept the default no base path.
* Click Save.
+
. In General, set Path to `/`.
. Accept the other default listener settings, and close the connector.
. Click + to add another component to the flow, select HTTP, and select the Request operation.
. Set up the request configuration:
+
* Accept the default HTTP request configuration name and HTTP protocol.
* Set the host. For example, set the host to `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.
* Set the port to 80.
* Set the base path to `/users`.
* Click Save.
+
. Accept the other default settings and close the connector.
. TBD ... Deploy the app, run the app, open a browser, and go to the URL you set up in the listener configuration. For example, `<host URL>.cloudhub.io:8081`.
+
The listener hears the request on port 8081, and starts the app. The requester gets a list of users, which appears in the browser.
