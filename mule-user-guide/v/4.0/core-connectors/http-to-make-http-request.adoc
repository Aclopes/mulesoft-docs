* Accept the default base path.
* Click Save.
+

. Add another HTTP connector to the flow, and select the request operation. 
. Set up the request configuration:

* Accept the default HTTP request configuration name and HTTP protocol.
* Set the host to `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.
* Set the port to 80.
* Set the base path to `/users`.
* Click Save.
+
. Accept the other default settings and close the connector.
. TBD ... Deploy the app, run the app, open a browser, and go to the URL you set up in the listener configuration. For example, `<host URL>.cloudhub.io:8081`.

The listener hears the request on port 8081, and starts the app. The requester gets a list of users, which appears in the browser.
