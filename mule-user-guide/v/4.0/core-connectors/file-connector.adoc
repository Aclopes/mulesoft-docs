[[what-is]]
== What is the File connector?

A connector that can operate on or retrieve information about files on a locally mounted file system.

== Features

* read, write and list files at any point of a flow
* retrieve metadata about a file
* define matchers to filter lists of files.
* get a best guess about the MIME type of a file.
* use the file connector with the `<poll>` and `<watermark>` elements
* watch a directory for created, updated or deleted files
* copy, move or delete a file automatically when processing is done
* recurse through a directoryâ€™s files and limit the recursion level
* check for file existence (useful for trigger file based use cases)
* copy, move or delete files at any point of the flow
* manually create a directory at any given point of the flow

[NOTE]
Special files like devices are not supported (for example: `/dev/null`)

== How to Configure

No configuration is required. You can directly perform a file operation in your flow. However, you can define a `<file-matcher>` above a flow to use across any file connector operations in your flow(s) or define them for one operation inside a `<file:match-with>` element.

Learn more about the operations in the link:/file-connector-technical-reference[File Connector].
