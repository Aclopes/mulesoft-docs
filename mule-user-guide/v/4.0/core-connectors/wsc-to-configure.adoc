Configuring the WSC means entering the connection details. The configuration for the web service consumer is basically a container for the connection. It only has one optional attribute: the *encoding*. The provided encoding in use in all requests and responses is managed by the *Consume* operation. If no encoding is specified, the web service consumer uses Mule's default encoding.

Configuring the WSC means entering the connection details.
