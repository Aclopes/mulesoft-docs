Uses an operation's *Error Mapping* fields to map custom error messages to error types, such as the `CONNECTIVITY` or `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED` error types.

. From the *Error Mapping* tab within a connector operation (such as *Delete*) in your flow, click the Plus icon (*+*) to open the list of error types for the operation.
. Click one or more error types.
. Enter your custom error message for the error type.
