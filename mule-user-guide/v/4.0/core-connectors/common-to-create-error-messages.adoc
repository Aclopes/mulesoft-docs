Anypoint Studio, Design Center: FTP connector

Uses an operation's *Error Mapping* fields to map custom error messages to the errors that the operation can return, such as the `CONNECTIVITY` or `REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED`.

. From an *Error Mapping* tab for an operation (such as *Delete*) in your flow, click the Plus icon (*+*) to open the list of error types for the operation.
. Click one or more error types.
. Enter your custom error message for the error type.
//. For other settings, go to link:#see_also[See also].
