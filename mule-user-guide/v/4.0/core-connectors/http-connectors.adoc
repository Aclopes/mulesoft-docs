HTTP connectors for Mule include:

* *HTTP listener*
* *HTTP requester*
* *Load static resource*
* *Basic auth security filter*

All are accessible from your Mule application design palette, typing "HTTP". The listener and requester require a *connector configuration*.

=== About HTTP Listener

Use the HTTP listener in the source (left) side to listen for requests that should trigger a Mule flow. Get back the generated HTTP response.

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/latest/http-listener-reference[HTTP Listener Reference]
* link:/http-listener-how-to[How to Use an HTTP Listener]
// List special configuration procedures from above doc below

=== About HTTP Requester

Send requests to a certain address and receive the returned response by placing the HTTP connector in the process side of the flow.

The request will return a `MuleMessage` with specific `HttpResponseAttributes`.

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/latest/http-request-reference[HTTP Requester Reference]
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-listener-connector#mapping-between-http-requests-and-mule-messages[Mapping HTTP Requests to MuleMessage]
* link:/http-listener-how-to[How to Use an HTTP Requester]
// List special configuration procedures from above doc below

=== About Load Static HTTP Resource

Select the `<load-static-resource>` operation and define the required attributes.

link:/load-static-resource-reference[Load Static Resource Reference]

=== About Basic Security Filter

Requires the status code and headersRef fields of a error-response-builder to be set as flow variables, so that the filter can set those. This option will allow the gateway to keep applying their basic auth policy in any order.

== How to Process HTTP Response Headers

response headers
prevent headers from being passed to the flow
disable outbound properties as headers in response

== How to Stream HTTP Requests or Responses through Listener

The transfer-encoding header is used to stream data through the HTTP connection so as not to read all into memory.

Transfer-encoding header is used to send the HTTP message body in chunks, saving us from having to know the body length in advance. Each chunk is separated by a predefined line separator, which contains the length of the particular chunk

For streaming using the HTTP Requester, see link:/#stream-requester[How to Stream through Requester]

== How to Customize HTTP Response Attributes

Set up the response so that it contains the desired body, attachment, headers and status.

== How to Send or Receive HTTPS requests

[NOTE]
Configuration depends on whether you have a HTTP server or client and whether or not you need two-way authentication.

Configure a TLS Context - see
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/tls-configuration[TLS Configuration]. If your configuration includes both a trust store and a key store, then it implements two-way TLS.

One-way scenarios:

Server implements key store to enforce client authentication
Client implements trust store (JVM's will be used if not provided)


== How to Send Authenticated Requests

== How to Send Multipart HTTP Requests

== How to Customize HTTP Requests

* Customize the body of the request using the `source` and `target` attributes
* For `GET`, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` methods, override the default empty body. Send a body with a request `sendBodyMode`
* Set headers, URI parameters explicitly or dynamically, using DataWeave language.
* Send form parameters in `POST` request

In Studio, the HTTP connector can work in one of two ways, depending on where it's placed in a flow:

* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener]
* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[HTTP Requester]

== HTTP Listener Quick Reference for Studio Users

To instantiate the connector as an *HTTP listener connector*, you must place it onto a blank Anypoint Studio canvas into the *Source* section of a new flow (i.e. as the first element in the flow) as you design your Mule application:

.New Flow Showing Source and Process Phases
image:source-flow-new-blank.png[show source and process section of flow]

.Drag the HTTP connector to the Source side
image:http-connector-drag-to-source.png[drag to source]

.See the connector populate the Source side

== HTTP Requester Quick Reference

To instantiate the connector as an *HTTP request connector*, you must place it into the *Process* section of a flow (ie: anywhere except the beginning of it):

.Drag the HTTP connector to the Process side
image:http-connector-drag-to-process.png[drag to process]

.Flow showing HTTP connector in Process side
image:http-connector-c3457.png[http request conn in process side]


....
[tab,title="XML Editor"]
....

When writing Mule projects in XML, the HTTP connector can work in one of two ways, depending on how you create it:

* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener]
* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/http-request-connector[HTTP Requester]

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, add the following XML tag at the start of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" />
----

To instantiate the connector as an HTTP Request Connector, add the following XML tag in any part of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_Configuration" path="/" method="GET" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:


[source,xml]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Configuration" host="example.com" port="8081"/>
----

....
------

[TIP]
To migrate a project that uses the old link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/deprecated-http-transport-reference[HTTP endpoint-based connector] to the new HTTP operation-based connector, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/migrating-to-the-new-http-connector[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector]. The old HTTP endpoint-based connector still works with Mule runtime 3.6, but it's deprecated and will eventually be removed.

[TIP]
You can edit the log4j2 configuration file to make the logging of the HTTP connector's activity a lot more verbose, if you need to. SeeÂ link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/logging-in-mule[Logging in Mule] for instructions.

== Debugging

Gaining visibility into HTTP inbound and outbound behavior can be achieved by enabling underlying library loggers with log4j2. This section assumes you're comfortable adjusting log levels with log4j2. If you have not adjusted logging levels in the past, read link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/logging-in-mule#configuring-custom-logging-settings[configuring custom logging settings] before continuing.

=== Logging Listener and Request Activity

By enabling the `DEBUG` level on `org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger`, activity coming from all HTTP Listener and Request components will be logged. This includes the HTTP Listener Connector's inbound request, HTTP Request Connector's outbound request, and each connector's response body. An example of each can be found below.


[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Listener Log Output"]
....

The log output of the Listener will display metadata of the inbound request.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 10:55:03,234 [[hello].HTTP_Listener_Configuration.worker.01] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: LISTENER
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8081
User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
Accept: */*
----

It will also display information about the response being sent back.

[source,bash]
----
LISTENER
HTTP/1.1 200
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Date: Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:55:03 GMT

2000
{
  "message" : "hello, world"
}
----

[TIP]
Chunked encoding will produce a separate log record for each chunk.

....
[tab,title="Request Log Output"]
....

The log output of the Request will display metadata of the outbound request.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:29:18,647 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration(1) SelectorRunner] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: REQUESTER
GET /v3/hello HTTP/1.1
Host: mocker-server.cloudhub.io:80
User-Agent: AHC/1.0
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*
----

It will also display information about the response sent back from the target.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:29:18,729 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration.worker(1)] org.mule.module.http.internal.HttpMessageLogger: REQUESTER
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:29:18 GMT
Server: nginx
Content-Length: 10940
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "message" : "Hello, world"
}
----

....
------

=== Logging Packet Metadata

At a lower level, it can be desirable to log the actual request and response packets transmitted over HTTP. This is achieved by enabling the `DEBUG` level on `com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly`. This will log the metadata of the request packets from `AsyncHTTPClientFilter` and the response packets from `AhcEventFilter`. Unlike the `HttpMessageLogger`, this will not log request or response bodies.

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Request Log Output"]
....

The log output of the request packet's metadata is as follows.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:16:29,421 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration(1) SelectorRunner] com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly.AsyncHttpClientFilter: REQUEST: HttpRequestPacket (
   method=GET
   url=/v3/hello
   query=null
   protocol=HTTP/1.1
   content-length=-1
   headers=[
      Host=mocker-server.cloudhub.io:80
      User-Agent=AHC/1.0
      Connection=keep-alive
      Accept=*/*]
)
----

....
[tab,title="Response Log Output"]
....

The log output of the response packet's metadata is as follows.

[source,bash]
----
DEBUG 2016-02-10 11:16:29,508 [[hello].http.requester.HTTP_Request_Configuration.worker(1)] com.ning.http.client.providers.grizzly.AhcEventFilter: RESPONSE: HttpResponsePacket (
  status=200
  reason=
  protocol=HTTP/1.1
  content-length=10940
  committed=false
  headers=[
      content-type=application/json
      date=Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:16:29 GMT
      server=nginx
      content-length=10940
      connection=keep-alive]
)
----

....
------

== Non-blocking Processing

The HTTP Connector (both the HTTP Listener and the HTTP Request connector) can be used with a non-blocking processing strategy. +
This means that whenever a message is pending a response from an external source, the message processor will still be free to process other messages that keep arriving to it. Read more about this in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/flow-processing-strategies#non-blocking-processing-strategy[Non-Blocking Processing Strategy].

To enable the non-blocking processing strategy, you must set this as a property in the `<flow>` element on which the HTTP Connector sits.

[NOTE]
Note that link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/flow-processing-strategies#supported-non-blocking-components[not all Mule components] currently support the non-blocking processing strategy, if there are any unsupported components in a flow, they will cause the flow to fall back to synchronous processing.
