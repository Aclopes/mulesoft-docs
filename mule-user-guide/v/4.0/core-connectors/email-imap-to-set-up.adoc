[[short_description]]
An IMAP configuration is required for all email retrieval operations that take place over the IMAP or IMAPS protocol. The IMAPS configuration requires a TLS configuration for encryption. Otherwise, the setup is identical to IMAP.

[[set_up_imap]]
. Open the `Email IMAP` window from any IMAP operation in your flow or from the *Connections Explorer* in Anypoint Studio.
. Provide a *Name* for the configuration, for example, `Email IMAP configuration`.
. Set the *Connection* to the email server:
  ** Identify which connection *Type* to use:
    ** *IMAP*
    ** *IMAPS*
  ** Identify the  *Host (required)*, for example, `imap.hostname.com` or the IP address.
  ** Provide any optional connection configurations, such as the *User*, *Password*, or alternative *Port* to use.
. For IMAPS only, set up the *TLS Configuration* for security, for example:
  ** *Enabled Protocols*: `TLSv1.2,SSLv3`
  ** *Trust store*: `greenmail.jks`
  ** *Password*: `somepassword`
  ** _TODO, LOOKS LIKE OTHERS ARE REQUIRED_
. If you do not want emails to be marked as opened and read when they are retrieved, disable `Eagerly fetch content`. For example, you might disable it if you only want to retrieve subjects without reading the content.

For other configuration options, see link:see_also[see_also].

TODO: CREATE FILES FOR THESE, SEE SEE ALSO FOR FILE NAMES
. Provide any optional settings you need:
  ** Customize *Properties* for the connection setting, _TODO, FOR EXAMPLE?_:
    *** From expression, _TODO, USAGE EXAMPLE?_
    *** Create a map of key value pairs, _TODO, USAGE EXAMPLE?_
  ** Opt to change the *Timeout Configuration* for the email connection,
  read, and write processes, for example, where the *Timeout Unit* changes from `SECONDS` to `HOURS` or the *Connection Timeout* changes from `5` to `6`.
  ** Opt to change the *Pooling Profile* that configures the connection pool.
  ** Provide a *Reconnection Strategy* that includes the frequency, count, and whether to block. _TODO, UNDERSTAND BLOCKING..._
