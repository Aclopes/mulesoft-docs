The *Consume* operation is the only web service consumer operation. It enables the execution of a web service operation providing the required information for the specific operation to execute.

For a connection, the web services consumer connector exposes a set of SOAP operations that can be executed, and selects the ones it wants to consume.  The connector also describes the required headers types, the body type, and the attachments if has any; and also describes the output message of the operation.

For input information, see <<Operation Input>>.

For output information, see <<Operation Output>>.

== Operation Input

The input consists of a *message* that represents a SOAP message. Input is composed of the body, a set of headers, and a set of attachments, all of which are optional parameters. For output information, see <<Operation Output>>.

The *Consume* operation requires only two parameters:

* Operation
* Message that represents the SOAP Message that is going to be built

The SOAP message consist of three parameters:

* `headers`: A set of XML headers
* `body`: The XML body or null if no body elements are required
* `attachments`:  A set of attachments

The output can be of two different types dependending on whether the response contains
attachments or not. If the response does not have attachments, the resulting type
is in plain XML with the information returned by the service. If the response
returns at least one attachment, the output type is a Multipart payload that
carries the plain XML response in the body plus additional parts for each retrieved
attachment by the service.

=== Body

The input body for an `operation` is XML that follows the element definition pointed to by the `message` part in the WSDL.

For example the SOAP `operation` definition (extracted from a WSDL file) looks like:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<operation name="echoAccount">
   <soap:operation soapAction="echoAccount"/>
   <input>
       <soap:body use="literal"/>
   </input>
   <output>
       <soap:body use="literal"/>
   </output>
</operation>
â€¦
<-- with this message definition !-->
<message name="echoAccount">
   <part name="parameters" element="tns:account"/>
</message>
<-- with this account type definition !-->
<xs:complexType name="account">
   <xs:sequence>
     <xs:element name="id" type="xs:long" minOccurs="0"/>
     <xs:element name="items" type="xs:string" nillable="true" minOccurs="0"/>
     <xs:element name="startingDate" type="xs:dateTime" minOccurs="0"/>
   </xs:sequence>
----

The body expects content such as the following to generate the correct SOAP envelope:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<con:echoAccount xmlns:con="http://consumer.ws.extension.mule.org/">
   <account>
       <id>12</id>
       <items>chocolate</items>
       <items>caramel</items>
       <items>vanilla</items>
       <startingDate>2017-03-02T00:00:00-03:00</startingDate>
   </account>
</con:echoAccount>
----

Metadata is provided to build the XML body using DataWeave.

=== No Body Required

When an operation doesn't have a required body, the Consume Operation accepts a null value as body and generates the required body part without parameters to fulfill the SOAP request.

An example auto-generated body:

[source,xml]
----
<con:operationName xmlns:con="http://consumer.ws.extension.mule.org/"/>
----

Only the operation's *Qname* is needed to generate the empty body request.

=== Body Attachment Elements

In a SOAP context, the attachments are part of the body, and the attachment can travel encoded as base64 right in the body, or have a reference to a part of a multipart HTTP message for example MTOM. For the Consume operation, this is not a concern and the body is agnostic of the attachments. The attachment elements are handled internally and the user does not need add attachment elements to the request body.

=== Headers

The headers are defined as a Map where each entry represents a header, the key of the entry defines the name of the header and the value is the header XML element.

The following example defines a header as a payload:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wsc:message>
   <wsc:headers>
      <wsc:header value="#[payload]" key="headerIn"/>
   </wsc:headers>
</wsc:message>
----

The payload carries this header:

[source,xml]
----
<con:headerIn  xmlns:con="http://service.ns/">Header In Value</con:headerIn>
----

Metadata is provided to build the headers using link:/mule-user-guide/v/4.0/dataweave[DataWeave] and all keys should be auto-populated with their values so that a user need only set the content for each header.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
{
  headerIn: "<con:headerIn  xmlns:con="http://service.ns/">Header In Value</con:headerIn>",
  headerNumberTwo: "<ns:someHeader/>"
}
----

=== SOAP Protocol Attachments

The SOAP protocol attachments are carried in the body. The Web Service Consumer connector supports SOAP with attachments that encode the body to base64, travel embedded in the body request, and support Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM), which efficiently sends binary data to and from web services. MTOM introduces the concept of sending the binary data separately from the XML body by including an XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) in place of the binary data that references the data that travels in a multipart-related message.

</con:echoAccount>

----
<con:uploadAttachment xmlns:con="http://consumer.ws.extension.mule.org/">
   <name>picture</name>
   <xop:include href="cid:SomeUniqueID"/>
</con:echoAccount>
----

Example with a MIME attachment:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
Content-id: "SomeUniqueID"
Content-Type: image/png

For both cases, the attachments are handled the same way. The Web Service Consumer connector adds the information that is required to the body depending on the type of connection you specify.

== Operation Output

The output of the Consume operation can be of two different types dependending on whether the response contains
attachments or not. If the response does not have attachments, the resulting type
is in plain XML with the information returned by the service. If the response
returns at least one attachment, the output type is a multi-part payload that
carries the plain XML response in the body plus additional parts for each retrieved
attachment by the service.

The output of the Consume operation is:

* *Output payload* - The output of the Consume operation can be a plain XML with the response body returned by the service or a multi-part payload with the XML response as body of the multi-part payload, plus one additional part for each attachment returned by the SOAP service.
* *Attributes* - Web service attributes are returned by each Consume operation invocation, together with the output payload. The attributes carry all the headers returned by the SOAP service (SOAP Headers) in XML format and all protocol specific headers returned upon operation request.

Both attributes and payload output provide metadata. For input information, see <<Operation Input>>.
