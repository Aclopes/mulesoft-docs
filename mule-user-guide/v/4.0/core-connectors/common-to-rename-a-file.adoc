. After adding the connector to your flow, select the *Rename* operation.
. Set up or select a configuration for the connector (see link:to-set-up-a-file-connector-config[To set up a File connector]).
. Set the *Path* to the file that you want to write. If you do not provide a path, the operation will attempt to discover it from the local file attributes associated with the message. If the attempt is unsuccessful, you will receive an error message.
