= Anypoint Object Store V2 - Beta
:keywords: osv2, object store, object, store

Object store v2 provides fast sharing of data and states across batch processes, mule components, multiple distributed applications, and enables use of distributed object store for advanced use cases such as API caching and API rate limiting. This new object store as a service integrated within the Anypoint platform enables users to use the object store in a self serve manner without needing to rely on central IT to set up a standalone or third party caching service. Object store v2 is horizontally scalable, resilient and distributed and enables a friction free and easier deployment of applications in CloudHub platform.

You can use the existing link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/object-store-connector[Object Store Connector] to create applications that write data to the object store.
