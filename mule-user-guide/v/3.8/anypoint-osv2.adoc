= Anypoint Object Store V2 - Beta
:keywords: osv2, object store, object, store

Object Store v2 provides fast sharing of data and states across batch processes, Mule components, multiple distributed applications, and enables use of a distributed object store for advanced use cases such as API caching and API rate limiting. Object Store v2 integrates as a service within Anypoint Platform and provides a self-service application object store that enables developers from relying on central IT to set up a standalone or third-party caching service. Object Store v2 is horizontally scalable, resilient, and distributed, and enables a friction-free and easier deployment of applications in CloudHub platform.
